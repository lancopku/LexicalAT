0 i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies ! 
0  . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
1 una pel�cula oscura , precisa , por momentos grandiosa y casi siempre conmovedora . 
1 occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almod�var style . 
0 fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
0 a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
1 angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . 
1 the film's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that's opened between them . 
1 proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they can't go wrong . better effects , better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh . an excellent sequel .

1 like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance . 
1 while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale . 
0 often silly and gross but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .

0 it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
0  . . . tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry . 
0 i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 
0 like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
1 reinforces the talents of screenwriter charlie kaufman , creator of adaptation and being john malkovich . 
1 blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances . 
0 this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
0 any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .

0 two-bit potboiler . 
1 beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that's there to scare while we delight in the images .

0 if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
0 both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
1 a gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost . 
0 it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
0 the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .

1 jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama . 
0 only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
1 the bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie .

1 a solid examination of the male midlife crisis . 
1 [cuar�n has] created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy . 
1 happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 
0 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
0 it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything .

1 suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed . 
1 jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory .

0 an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
1 a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy . 
1 the powerful success of read my lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers . 
0 in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space . 
1 a live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze . 
1 works because reno doesn't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience . 
1 a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . 
0 as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
0 a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
0 ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
1 the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired . 
1 good , solid storytelling . 
1 nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending . 
1 great character interaction . 
0 when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .

0 it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
1 it's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions . 
0 the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
0  . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
0 may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
0 in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage's war-weary marine . 
1 neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm . 
0 about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
1 compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder . 
1 this is a winning ensemble comedy that shows canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world . 
1  . . . is there a deeper , more direct connection between these women , one that spans time and reveals meaning ? you bet there is and it's what makes this rather convoluted journey worth taking . 
1 vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop . 
0 shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
0 the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting .

0 first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction . 
1 an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty . 
0 if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna . 
0 the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
0 the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it . 
1 in addition to hoffman's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday . 
0 under-rehearsed and lifeless
0 feels familiar and tired . 
1 i'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent . 
1 if steven soderbergh's 'solaris' is a failure it is a glorious failure . 
0 no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas . 
1 sure , it's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it's never as solid as you want it to be . 
1 those who would follow haneke on his creepy explorations . . . are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from huppert and magimel . 
0 much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
1 manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . 
1 it gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right .

1 director of photography benoit delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors , and the costumes and sets are grand . 
0 the central story lacks punch . 
0 even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage . 
0 an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
1 those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find what time is it there ? well worth the time . 
0 looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
0 it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
1 while not quite " shrek " or monsters , inc . " , it's not too bad . it's worth taking the kids to . 
0 horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
1 with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintar�'s metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own . 
0 it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original . 
1 feral and uncomfortable . 
0 lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun . 
0 her film is like a beautiful food entr�e that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
1 the movie is well done , but slow . 
0 just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny . 
1 charlotte sometimes is a brilliant movie . it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity . 
0 essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
1 moving and vibrant . 
0  coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
0 it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
0 simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
1 the performances of the four main actresses bring their characters to life . a little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged . 
1 despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center . 
1 but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity . 
0 this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
1 the movie should be credited with remembering his victims . 
1 dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch . 
0 samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
1 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great �what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
0 beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .

0 'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
1 contando com uma premissa curiosa , o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense , culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na mem�ria . 
0 it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
0 davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly . 
1 the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one . 
0 the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
1 remember the kind of movie we were hoping " ecks vs . sever " or " xxx " was going to be ? this is it . 
1 the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before . 
0 the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
0 the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it . 
1 the chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between gauls and yanks . 
0 'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
0 fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . 
0 such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
0 scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 
0 perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
1 a confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design . 
1 the film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in . 
0 not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
0 astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
1 the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next . 
1 the message of such reflections--intentional or not--is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one . 
0 its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
1 this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer's star trek vi : the undiscovered country . 
0 a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . 
0 if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 
1 if you grew up on scooby -- you'll love this movie . matthew lillard is born to play shaggy ! 
0 the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
0 to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
1 beneath clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from rabbit-proof fence . 
0 if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
1 spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing . 
0 ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue . 
1 to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed . 
1 an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles . 
1 the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
1 as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth . 
1 provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue . 
1 crammed with incident , and bristles with passion and energy . 
0 in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled . 
1 the banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group . . . and never fails to entertain . 
1 we know the plot's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish . 
0 it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 
0 check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
1 superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . 
1 the pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of steven spielberg's schindler's list . but mr . polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr . spielberg's 1993 classic . 
1 got a david lynch jones ? then you'd do well to check this one out because it's straight up twin peaks action . . . 
0 new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
0 an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it . 
0 it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
1 even if you can't pronounce " gyro " correctly , you'll appreciate much of vardalos' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries . 
1 [haynes'] homage to such films as " all that heaven allows " and " imitation of life " transcends them . simply put , " far from heaven " is a masterpiece . 
0 make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess . 
0 had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
0 the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
1 missteps take what was otherwise a fascinating , riveting story and send it down the path of the mundane . 
0 the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
0 director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
0 we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
1 with dickens' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told . 
0 a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
0 the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
0 a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
0 this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
1 beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 
1 the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries . 
1 the movie isn't just hilarious : it's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it isn't even all that dumb . 
0 the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . 
1 playfully profound . . . and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows . 
0 jonah is only so-so . . . the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it . 
1 although it doesn't always hang together -- violence and whimsy don't combine easily -- " cherish " certainly isn't dull . 
0 veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
1 most haunting about " fence " is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen . noyce's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us

1 witty , touching and well paced . 
1 what a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride . this is a more fascinating look at the future than " bladerunner " and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen . 
1 it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days . 
1 claude chabrol's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements .

0 a decidedly mixed bag . 
1 while parker and co-writer catherine di napoli are faithful to melville's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast . . . have made the old boy's characters more quick-witted than any english lit major would have thought possible .

0  ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's . 
1 a harrowing account of a psychological breakdown .

1 compellingly watchable . 
1 a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising . 
0 so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie . 
1 a strangely compelling and brilliantly acted psychological drama . 
0 the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset . 
0 the film wasn't preachy , but it was feminism by the book . 
0 not so much farcical as sour . 
0 even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
0 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
1 reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it's still pretty tasty .

0 a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned . 
0 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
1 passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly . . .

1 the formula is familiar but enjoyable . 
1 you needn't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes' work . though haynes' style apes films from the period . . . its message is not rooted in that decade . 
1 it is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction .

0 proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
1 cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most . 
1 it's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america . 
0 festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
1 where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence . 
0 the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
0 the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption . 
0 the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
0 this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned . 
1 if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
1 offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works . 
1 from the big giant titles of the opening credits to elmer bernstein's perfectly melodic score , haynes gets just about everything right . 
1 for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded . 
0 a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
1 it's funny , as the old saying goes , because it's true . 
0 too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel . 
1 without resorting to hyperbole , i can state that kissing jessica stein may be the best same-sex romance i have seen .

1 gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive . 
1 armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud . 
1 although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film doesn't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything . 
1 elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 
1 chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
0 shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
0 sodden and glum , even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light . 
1 the film has several strong performances . 
0 the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing . 
0 screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
1 features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer's block ever . 
1 high on melodrama . but it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .

0 harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . 
0 while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary .

1 it's a masterpiece . 
0 julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
1 the reason to see " sade " lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis ( auteil ) and emilie ( le besco ) . 
0 the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys . 
1 the film is a fierce dance of destruction . its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude . 
0 the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
0 [a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment .

0 you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 
0 este � apenas mais um ( longo ) epis�dio do programa da mtv . a �nica diferen�a � que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas . 
0 it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
0 manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite . 
1 it's the filmmakers' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time b movies good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion . 
1 director nalin pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other . he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works . no question . 
1 for the most part , the film does hold up pretty well . 
1 despite its shortcomings , girls can't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre . 
1 a gentle and engrossing character study . 
1 what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved . 
0 this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
0 there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
0 the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it . 
0 a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
0 it's probably not easy to make such a worthless film . . . 
0 the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
0 enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . 
0 well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
1 i have a new favorite musical -- and i'm not even a fan of the genre
1 a difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present . 
1 a mess , but it's a sincere mess . 
1 a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions . 
1 roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck � few filmmakers will . but based on cq , i'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project . 
1 a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over . 
0 this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved . 
0 as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
0 'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
0 criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
0 sayles . . . once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
1 this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first . 
0 the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
1 plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel . 
1 a captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age . 
1 a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing . 
1 there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache . 
0 whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
1 the son's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos . 
0 at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
1 a giddy and provocative sexual romp that has something to say . 
1 the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . 
1 humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way . 
1 from both a great and a terrible story , mr . nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience . 
0 while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
0 those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals . 
1 the cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael . 
0 ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
0 the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
1 like other great documentaries . . . this goes after one truth ( the ford administration's complicity in tearing 'orphans' from their mothers ) and stumbles upon others even more compelling . 
0 nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
0 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
1 if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
0 even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
0 cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
1 a moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places , unexamined lives . 
1 a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions . 
1 makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran's borderlands . 
1 the leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits . 
1 it's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth . 
1 would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ? do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man's body ? if you answered yes , by all means enjoy the new guy . 
0 nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
0 tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident . 
0 be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 
0 dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
0 collapses under its own meager weight . 
1 more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling . 
1 coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema . 
0 there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
0 while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
0 the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
1 this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed . 
1 the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache . 
0 even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
0 halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . 
0 there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
1 a muted freak-out
1 it all adds up to good fun . 
0 a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
1 a competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
0 we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product . 
0 an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
0 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
1 if you're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you're in luck . 
0 reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby . 
1 invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion . 
1 the comedy makes social commentary more palatable . 
0 all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
1 once the downward spiral comes to pass , auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera . . . 
1 os universos de chuck barris e charlie kaufman s�o complementares . e igualmente fascinantes . 
0 the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater . 
0 'men in black ii creates a new threat for the mib , but recycles the same premise . 
1 it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . 
1 seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil . 
1 able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history . 
0 wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
0 dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . 
1 an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence . 
1 it's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence . 
0 what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
1 children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted . 
1 whether writer-director anne fontaine's film is a ghost story , an account of a nervous breakdown , a trip down memory lane , all three or none of the above , it is as seductive as it is haunting . 
0 they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
1 while broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system . 
0 a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences . 
1 despite the film's shortcomings , the stories are quietly moving . 
1 it's fairly solid--not to mention well edited so that it certainly doesn't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark . 
0 the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 
1 watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power . 
0 a tv episode inflated past its natural length . 
1 like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it's one tough rock . 
1 brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film . 
0 an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
0 with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger . 
0 one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
1 a touching , sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes . 
1 although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of middle america . 
1 as teen movies go , " orange county " is a refreshing change
0 the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
1 the comic performances are all spot on , especially lee ross's turn as ken . 
0 the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . 
1 it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study . 
1 a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma . 
1 by turns very dark and very funny . 
0 the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 
1 it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding . 
0 it's drab . it's uninteresting . it squanders chan's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt ! 
1 this is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the saturday matinee , and it still is . 
0 novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
0 unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party . 
0 a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
1 this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride . 
0 what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
0  if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
1 it's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more . 
0 oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
1 as allen's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson . 
1 a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives . 
1 williams absolutely nails sy's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness . 
0 because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
0 sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . 
1 the movie is full of fine performances , led by josef bierbichler as brecht and monica bleibtreu as helene weigel , his wife . 
0 director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
0 pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
1 a documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary . 
1 few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying . 
0 except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
0 the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
0 this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . 
1 it's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime . 
0 a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
1 the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes . 
1 either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks . 
0 a major waste . . . generic . 
1 not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
1 it's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 . 
1 [fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall] show us the world they love and make us love it , too . 
0 cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
1 workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies . 
0 a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
0 one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
1 two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy . 
1  . . . gripping and handsome execution , ( but ) there isn't much about k-19 that's unique or memorable . 
1 the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
1 an intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected . 
0 while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
1 [a] rare , beautiful film . 
1 a weird , arresting little ride . 
1 possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it's directed by . . . neil labute . hmm . 
0 though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
0 simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
1 the dramatic crisis doesn't always succeed in its quest to be taken seriously , but huppert's volatile performance makes for a riveting movie experience . 
0 one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced . 
0 just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough . 
0 sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates . 
0 bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 
0 kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
1 it's immensely ambitious , different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do . 
0 it's exactly what you'd expect . 
1 both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 
0 strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
0 it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it .

0 after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna . 
1 a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture . 
1 huppert and girardot give performances of exceptional honesty . 
0 paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 
0 just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
1 what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 
0 a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
1 a weird and wonderful comedy . 
0 lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
1 it is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one . 
1 has a solid emotional impact . 
1 it's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller . 
1 'compleja e intelectualmente retadora , el ladr�n de orqu�deas es uno de esos filmes que vale la pena ver precisamente por su originalidad . '
1 insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it doesn't disgrace it , either . 
0 there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
1 if the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care . 
1 stands as one of the year's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be . 
0 mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
1 belongs to daniel day-lewis as much as it belongs to martin scorsese ; it's a memorable performance in a big , brassy , disturbing , unusual and highly successful film . 
0 the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . 
0 adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .

1 grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors . 
0 who needs love like this ? 
1 it's hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon's] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . 
0 the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
1 while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth . 
0 contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
1 somewhat blurred , but kinnear's performance is razor sharp . 
1 spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but " spider-man " certainly delivers the goods . 
0 feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot . 
0 mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .

1 renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing . 
0 it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
1 mr . tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor .

0 i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
1 one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece . 
1 ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . 
0 this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . 
0 i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
1 both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver . 
1 unfortunately , it appears that [jackie] chan's us influence is starting to show in his hong kong films . 
0 it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
1 about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more , houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him . 
1 the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie .

0 black-and-white and unrealistic . 
0 done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
1 often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part . 
1 jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging . 
0  . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
1 it helps that lil bow wow . . . tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid . 
0 several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
0 it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
0 blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .

0 first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ? 
0 it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
1 almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like " the addams family " to everyone looking in . . . " my big fat greek wedding " comes from the heart . . . 
0 its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
0  . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
1 defies logic , the laws of physics and almost anyone's willingness to believe in it . but darned if it doesn't also keep us riveted to our seats . 
0 this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
1 the cast comes through even when the movie doesn't . 
1 everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse . 
1 don't judge this one too soon - it's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going . 
1 nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '
0 brisk hack job . 
1 the rock is destined to be the 21st century's new " conan " and that he's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal . 
1 there's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . and yet , it still works . 
1 uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof . 
0 this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
0 chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
0 life is a crock -- or something like it .

1 the lady and the duke is a smart , romantic drama that dares to depict the french revolution from the aristocrats' perspective . 
1 the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness . 
0 if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
1 y tu mam� tambi�n is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt .

1 this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places . 
0 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
1 makes s&m seem very romantic , and maggie gyllenhaal is a delight . 
0 the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 
1 a confident , richly acted , emotionally devastating piece of work and 2002's first great film
1 'like a child with an important message to tell . . . [skins'] faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty . '
1 one of the best of a growing strain of daring films . . . that argue that any sexual relationship that doesn't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect . 
0 in the end , there isn't much to it .

0 maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
0 ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . 
1 carrying off a spot-on scottish burr , duvall ( also a producer ) peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper . 
1 a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania . 
0 abysmally pathetic
1 hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love . 
1 a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers . 
0  . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 
0 [l]ame and unnecessary . 
0 ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would .

1 the large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes . 
0  . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks . 
0 scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 
1 leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other . 
0 no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised .

0 as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .

1 noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama . 
0 dilbert without the right-on satiric humor . 
1 the special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original , while the oscar-winning sound and james horner's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system .

1 a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man .

0 it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
0 blue crush is so prolonged and boring it isn't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be . 
1 if you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore , you'll see del toro has brought unexpected gravity to blade ii . 
1  . . . an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly shouldn't hurt talented young gaghan's resume .

0  . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense . 
1 in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
1 another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .

1 halloween : resurrection isn't exactly quality cinema , but it isn't nearly as terrible as it cold have been . 
1 [the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful . 
0 if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
0 it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script . 
1 assayas' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne's novel . 
1 chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson's dahmer . 
1 both damning and damned compelling . 
1 sitting in the third row of the imax cinema at sydney's darling harbour , but i sometimes felt as though i was in the tiny two seater plane that carried the giant camera around australia , sweeping and gliding , banking and hovering over some of the most not
0 directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
1 my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more . 
0 though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
0 the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
0 the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
0 i'm just too bored to care . 
1 an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood . 
0 the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
1 there has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently . . . but peter mattei's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note . 
0 'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances . 
0 stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
0 isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
1 steven soderbergh doesn't remake andrei tarkovsky's solaris so much as distill it . 
0 a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
0 it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots . 
0 there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double . 
0 a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
1 the seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going . 
1 you don't need to know your ice-t's from your cool-j's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california . 
0 twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
1 at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future . 
1 a powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution . 
1 a charming but slight comedy . 
1 what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action . 
0 its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
1 stevens' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls . 
0 another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
0 just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 
0 a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
1 there's absolutely no reason why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is
0 nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
1 exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes . 
0 at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 
1 the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head . 
0 only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
1 the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear . 
1 mike white's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make " " the good girl " a film worth watching . 
1 the film offers an intriguing what-if premise . 
1 though the film is static , its writer-director's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable . 
1 awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over . 
0 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . 
1 garc�a bernal and talanc�n are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you'll want things to work out . 
1 further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of dubya's axis of evil . 
1 as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet's airless cinematic shell games . 
0 the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
0 phoned-in business as usual . 
1 vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role . 
1 a film in a class with spike lee's masterful do the right thing . 
0 the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles � several of them . 
1 fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn . 
1 the movie is brilliant , really . it is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events . 
1 a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department . 
0 there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious . 
0 there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
1 a full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence . 
1 jeffrey tambor's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy . 
1 remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it's an adventure story and history lesson all in one . 
1 touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society . . . might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants . 
0 doesn't really add up to much . 
1 morton deserves an oscar nomination . 
0 kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . ) 
1 it thankfully goes easy on the reel/real world dichotomy that [jaglom] pursued with such enervating determination in venice/venice . 
0 short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight� tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
0  . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
0 although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league . 
0 without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
0 whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
1 thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer . 
1 it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good . 
0 combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he's shooting the latest system of a down video . 
0 most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
1 bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it . 
1 at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance . 
0 it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
1  i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint . 
1 like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive . 
0 this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson . 
1 easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year . 
0 it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
0 a fifty car pileup of cliches . 
0 represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
1 assured , glossy and shot through with brittle desperation . 
0 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn . 
0 culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
0 i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problem�it's supposed to be a drama . 
1 an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection . 
0 there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
0 the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
0 for dance completists only . 
1 a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . 
0 how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
1 it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity . 
1 the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much . 
0 suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood . 
0 lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
1 all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based . 
1 while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them . 
1 sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling . and in this regard , on guard delivers . 
1 constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act . 
0 pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut . 
0 'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived . 
1 m�nch's genuine insight makes the film's occasional overindulgence forgivable . 
0 moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
0 an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
1 if you've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart . this is the best star trek movie in a long time . 
1 could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
0 you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus . 
1  . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 
1 oddly compelling . 
1 the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry . 
0 it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did . 
0 shallow , noisy and pretentious . 
1 it will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth . 
1 thoughtful , provocative and entertaining . 
1 sits uneasily as a horror picture . . . but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family . 
0 this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips . 
0 it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
1 it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . 
1 still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at 'face value' to recommend to anyone looking for something different . 
0 in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
1 smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem . 
0 on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
0  . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
0 just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
0 too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
0 too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . 
0 louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
1 an exquisitely crafted and acted tale . 
1 it isn't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems . 
0 for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
0 the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
0 as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
1 a beautiful paean to a time long past . 
1 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive . 
1 i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe . 
1 from blushing to gushing---imamura squirts the screen in �warm water under a red bridge'
1 a crisp psychological drama [and] a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old " twilight zone " episode . 
0 'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad . 
0 the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
0 hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
0 writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
0 narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
1 unlike most surf movies , blue crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave . by the end you can't help but feel 'stoked . '
0 [stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits . 
0 the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
0 scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole . 
0 the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
1 passable entertainment , but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards . 
0 [creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
0 the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
0 an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . 
0 it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
1 the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional . 
0 slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 
0 city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
1 bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough . 
0 has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
1 if you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it's informative and breathtakingly spectacular . 
1  . . . the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house . that's fun for kids of any age . 
0 despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
0 none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
1 frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films i've ever seen . 
1 has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope . 
1 sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna doesn't suck as an actress . 
0 seriously , rent the disney version . 
0 even in this less-than-magic kingdom , reese rules . 
0 a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
0 predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
1 about schmidt is nicholson's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear . 
0 uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
1 although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing . 
1 the bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they've told a nice little story in the process . 
0 for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless . 
0 i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
0 what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . 
0 it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that . 
0 choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
1 it's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! 
0 nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives . 
0 though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before . 
1 it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . 
1 as unseemly as its title suggests . 
1 dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then there's the music . . . 
0 everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
0 i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
0 despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
0 the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
1 entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say , entertaining ! 
0 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
1 gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth . 
1 cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone . 
0 a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
0 sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
1 jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . 
0 clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up . 
1 may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done . 
1 a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration . 
1 the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful . 
0 a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
1 a venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director's understanding of the expressive power of the camera . 
0 flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent . 
0 sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't . 
1 a taut psychological thriller that doesn't waste a moment of its two-hour running time . 
1 has its share of arresting images . 
1 attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage . 
1 astonishing . . . [frames] profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment . 
0 it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man clich� atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
1 stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid . 
0 guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep . 
1 it's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just can't take it any more . 
1 a small movie with a big impact . 
0 with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp . 
1 gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film . 
1 a few artsy flourishes aside , narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days . 
0 it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
0 impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
0 it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
1 daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who aren't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war . 
0 presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
0 the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
0 fails to bring as much to the table . 
1 the best part about " gangs " was daniel day-lewis . 
1  " the ring " is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws . 
0 director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
1 it's nice to see piscopo again after all these years , and chaykin and headly are priceless . 
0 this is amusing for about three minutes . 
0 though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
1 compassionately explores the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children . 
1 it may . . . work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns . 
0 an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously . 
1 a refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale . 
1 this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics . 
1 the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties . 
1 a beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder . 
0 trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the " gadzooks ! " 
1 a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
1 the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays . 
0 tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
1 this story still seems timely and important . and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene's story ends . 
0 it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 
1 [westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera . 
0 did the film inform and educate me ? yes . did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 armenia ? no . and that is where ararat went astray . 
1 if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of " the isle " you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else . 
0 given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
0 movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
0 the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
0 the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 
1 take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length . 
1 bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era's creme de la celluloid . 
1 not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers -- it's a spirited film and a must-see . 
0 ecks this one off your must-see list . 
1 what makes esther kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony . but it's worth the concentration . 
0 it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
0 an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
1 the charm of revolution os is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers . 
0 humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
0 i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
0 there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
0 drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
0 displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
1 for all its problems . . . the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring . . . which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience . 
1 the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension .

1  . . . tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope . 
1 ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it . 
0 an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
1 captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world . 
0 patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary . 
1 the result puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally couldn't care less . 
1 drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth . 
1 quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor . 
0 a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . 
1 the power of shanghai ghetto , a documentary by dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s . 
1 it's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor . 
1 chris columbus' sequel is faster , livelier and a good deal funnier than his original . 
1 there is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye . 
0 directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space . 
1 the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained . 
0 for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
1 it's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties . 
1 by surrounding us with hyper-artificiality , haynes makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way . 
0 a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
0 this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
0 feeble comedy . 
1 a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality . 
1 filled with alexandre desplat's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience . 
1 at its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture . 
1 a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages . 
1 while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you won't care . 
1 smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play . 
0 although sensitive to a fault , it's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken . 
0 will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
0 a well-acted , but one-note film . 
1 a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters . 
0 the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
1 it's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout . 
1 writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted . 
1 one of the best , most understated performances of [jack nicholson's] career . 
0 with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
0 though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
0 buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clich�s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
0 there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
1 fast and funny , an action cartoon that's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd . 
1 though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . 
1 it won't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee . 
1 ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine . 
0 de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
1 a coming-of-age movie that hollywood wouldn't have the guts to make . 
0 the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
1 an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true . 
0 most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
1 an intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch . 
0 the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
1 rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material . 
1 at the film's centre is a precisely layered performance by an actor in his mid-seventies , michel piccoli . 
1 even when he's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work . 
1 enticing and often funny documentary . 
1 judith and zaza's extended bedroom sequence . . . is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics . 
1 the two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie . 
1 the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year . 
0 in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
1 fulford-wierzbicki . . . deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen . 
0 aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
1 a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film . search it out . 
1 heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter n�ss' delicate , clever direction . . . and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius . 
0 the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
1 satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity . 
0 as plain and pedestrian as catsup--
0 it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
0 despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '
1 even through its flaws , revolution #9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film . 
1 a great comedy filmmaker knows great comedy needn't always make us laugh . tim story's not there yet - but 'barbershop' shows he's on his way . 
0 watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
0 woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another . 
0 it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
1 from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir . 
1 cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective . 
0 there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
0 forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
1 arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
1 i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie . 
1 b�art and berling are both superb , while huppert . . . is magnificent . 
1 an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves . 
1 worth watching for dong jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change . 
0 i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . 
0 while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
1 trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . 
1 piercingly affecting . . . while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying . 
1 a film of ideas and wry comic mayhem . 
1 with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill . 
1 ranges from laugh-out-loud hilarious to wonder-what- time-it-is tedious . 
0 the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
0 shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . 
0 the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
1 while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel . 
1 the performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart . 
0 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
0 too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
0 while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house . 
1 a compelling journey . . . and " his best friend remembers " is up there with the finest of specials . 
0 what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
0 the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
0 the original wasn't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! 
0 ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 
1 a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . 
0 a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well . 
0 a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
0 the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
1 it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster . 
1 a movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you don't want to be . 
1 diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy . 
1 as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm . 
1 what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
1 it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg's film is that it truly is romance
0 about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
0 lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
1 this is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its freud and knows its sade . 
1 [city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
1 there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film . . . or the emotional integrity of the performances . 
0 ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
0 throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
1 s1m0ne's satire is not subtle , but it is effective . it's a quirky , off-beat project . . . . 
0 viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
1 watching spirited away is like watching an eastern imagination explode . 
1 less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself . 
0 it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
0 there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
0 the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
0 if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
1 nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition . 
1 unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of�emotional recovery . 
1 a pure participatory event that malnourished intellectuals will gulp down in a frenzy . 
0 'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
1 not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies . 
1 the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations . 
1 idiotic and ugly . 
1 a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world . 
1 for 95 often hilarious minutes , [cho] riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outr� sexual practice . 
1 gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife . 
1 it is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some . i haven't seen one in so long , no wonder i didn't recognize it at first . 
0 the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
0 it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
1 escapism in its purest form . 
1  ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . . 
0 what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes . 
1 like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about north korea's recent past and south korea's future adds a much needed moral weight . 
0 by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
1 standing in the shadows of motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow . 
0 so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
1 it's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look . 
1 anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher . 
1 a woman's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken . 
0 the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass . 
1  . . . a light , yet engrossing piece . lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject � taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history . 
0 in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
0 nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
0 there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
1 the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor . 
0 arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces . 
1 opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half . 
1 rubbo's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-shakespeare controversy . 
0 beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
0 the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
1 with 'bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear .

1 whether you're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you'll still feel something . 
1 there is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . paul cox needed to show it . it is up to you to decide if you need to see it . 
0 believability wasn't one of the film's virtues . 
1 this is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek ( as well as a serious debt to the road warrior ) , but it feels like unrealized potential
1 a poignant , artfully crafted meditation on mortality . 
0 it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
1  " on guard ! " won't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time . 
0 la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , r�pidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
1 call it magic realism or surrealism , but miss wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity . 
1 transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games . 
1 offers that rare combination of entertainment and education . 
1 evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones . 
1 you'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama . 
1 a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome . 
1 forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power . 
1 there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling . 
1 the attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way . 
1 rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language . 
1 a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . 
0  . . . a rather bland affair . 
0 build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year . 
1 post 9/11 the philosophical message of " personal freedom first " might not be as palatable as intended . 
0 the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
0 impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
1 this submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to das boot . 
0 nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
1 two hours fly by -- opera's a pleasure when you don't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated . 
1 for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough . 
0 for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
0 a noble failure . 
0 it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
1 if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on .

1 this is a superior horror flick . 
0 claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem . 
0 a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
1  " extreme ops " exceeds expectations . good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography . 
0 instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
1 this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other . 
0 it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
0 the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
1 director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . and there's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together . 
0 god is great , the movie's not . 
1 by the end of the movie , you're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular . 
0 hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't .

0 first-time director jo�o pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on . 
1 a tone of rueful compassion . . . reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events . 
0 unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare . 
0 there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
0 never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
1 many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . 
0 it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
0 this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
1 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
1 birthday girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked . 
0 priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal . 
1 kinnear's performance is a career-defining revelation . 
0 the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
0 the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .

0 contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
1 tsai ming-liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being . 
0 let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
0 it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
0  . . . stale and uninspired . 
1 even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
0 it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
1 an uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
0 arty gay film . 
0 melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
0 its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
0 it recycles every clich� about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
1 broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed . 
0 no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 
0 sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower . 
1 the film's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality . 
0 its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
0 �a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason . 
1 the film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet . 
1 a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
0 too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
1 singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs � a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story � but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece . 
0 corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
0 too much of the humor falls flat . 
1 it is scott's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph . 
0 to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
0 the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
0 although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
0 death might be a release . 
0 the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
1 director nancy savoca's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could . 
1 it's fairly self-aware in its dumbness . 
1 a solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration . 
0 diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . 
0 dreary tale of middle-class angst
1 the director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut . 
0 k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich . 
1 [d]espite its familiar subject matter , ice age is consistently amusing and engrossing . . . 
0 i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
0 forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore . 
0 the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
1 collateral damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't . 
1 everything about the quiet american is good , except its timing . 
1 although estela bravo's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro , it's still a guilty pleasure to watch . 
1 exhilarating but blatantly biased . 
0 the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
0 the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
1 in the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , like mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency . 
1  . . . a haunting vision , with images that seem more like disturbing hallucinations . 
0 i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's . 
0 it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies . 
1 australian actor/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation . 
1 this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap . 
1 waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . 
1 worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 
0 the script kicks in , and mr . hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . 
1 the wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough . 
0 kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention . 
0 aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
0 the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
1 there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
0 a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches , no matter how 'inside' they are . 
0 it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
0 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
1 rabbit-proof fence will probably make you angry . but it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that doesn't make you feel like a sucker . 
1 a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last . 
1 intimate and panoramic . 
1 just how these families interact may surprise you . 
0 every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
1 the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer . 
0 those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
0 the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
1 in death to smoochy , we don't get williams' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing . 
1 just what makes us happy , anyway ? 
0  . . . the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank . 
1 el t�tulo no enga�a : la pel�cula narra una historia donde una mujer enfrentar� cierta realidad , y donde el sexo es . . . 
0 after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 
1 perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing , ' but it is . 'drumline' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 
0 the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
0 some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
1  " home movie " is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book . 
1 simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad . 
0 represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
0 less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
1 though frodo's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle . 
0 if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil . 
1 a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be . 
1 the locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches . the story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic . 
0 the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
1 an overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort . 
1 this is not a retread of " dead poets' society . " 
0 adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
1 the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . 
0 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
0 authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 
0 ihops don't pile on this much syrup . 
1 it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal . 
1 an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids . 
1 the actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them . 
1 in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway . 
0 several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
1 you just know something terrible is going to happen . but when it does , you're entirely unprepared . 
0 give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour . 
1 the directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor's doorstep . but the actors make this worth a peek . 
0  . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . 
1 despite its flaws . . . belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn . 
1 one of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year . 
0 an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
1 a funny , triumphant , and moving documentary . 
1 this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative . 
0 basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
1 it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process . 
0 i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers . 
1 the structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings . 
0 the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
1 the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
0  . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
1 you might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see " simone , " and consider a dvd rental instead . 
0 the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
1 for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
1 the film is full of charm . 
0 in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
0 really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 
0 the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
1 twist open the ouzo ! it's time to let your hair down greek style . a vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it , my big fat greek wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , colour and cringe . 
0 some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
1 a quietly moving look back at what it was to be iranian-american in 1979 . 
1 about the best thing you could say about narc is that it's a rock-solid little genre picture . whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste . 
1 chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of 'ethnic cleansing . '
0 this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
0 brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors . . . by shoving them into every clich�d white-trash situation imaginable . 
1 shiner can certainly go the distance , but isn't world championship material
0 a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 
1 this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . 
1 this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . 
1 fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply . 
0 mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
1  " auto focus " works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
1 it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . 
1 the cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story . 
1 the music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and italy beckons us all . 
1 there's an energy to y tu mam� tambi�n . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors . 
1  . . . a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism . 
1 shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
0 schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
1 in between all the emotional seesawing , it's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . but they fascinate in their recklessness . 
0 it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
1 it's refreshing to see a romance this smart . 
0 takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
1 veret� has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs . 
1 henry bean's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect
1 one can't deny its seriousness and quality . 
1 tells ( the story ) with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot's persnickety problems is simply a matter of ( being ) in a shrugging mood . 
0 this is a truly , truly bad movie . 
1 this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography . 
1 in the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned . 
1 audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film's tart , sugar-free wit . 
1 a true-blue delight . 
0 bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
1 this enthralling documentary . . . is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends . 
1 it's not a great monster movie . but if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there's guilty fun to be had here . chomp chomp ! 
1 [gai] comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form . 
0 however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
1 as the movie traces mr . brown's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times . 
1 as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness . her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant . 
1 i can't say that i liked homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way . 
1 nice piece of work . 
1 although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching . 
1 clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable . . . 
0 human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
0 originality is sorely lacking . 
0 in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
0 the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . 
0 it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
1 narc is a no-bull throwback to 1970s action films . it zips along with b-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special . 
1 allows us to hope that nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker . 
1 the saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world . 
0 enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs . 
0 in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh . 
1 more intimate than spectacular , e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
0 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
1 those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know . 
1 jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness . 
0 constantly slips from the grasp of its maker . 
1 the film may appear naked in its narrative form . . . but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the catholic doctrine
1 intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery . 
0 a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness . 
1 now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . 
0 the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
1  " 13 conversations about one thing " is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling . 
0 exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
0 this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
0  . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
0 it's just rather leaden and dull . 
1 theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical . 
0 the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste . 
1 it might be 'easier' to watch on video at home , but that shouldn't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 
0 storytelling feels slight . 
0 enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid . 
1 a behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that's made a difference to nyc inner-city youth . 
0 a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
1 exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . 
0 here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
1 stevenson's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination . 
1 the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill . 
0 for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
0 hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
0 the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
1 even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , east-vs . -west coast rap wars , this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate . 
0 like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless . 
0 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
1 bouquet gives a performance that is masterly . 
1 the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission . 
1 there's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like steven spielberg to follow a . i . with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority . 
1 shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience . 
0 hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
0 there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
1 the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them . strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency . 
1 asks what truth can be discerned from non-firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema's capability for recording truth . 
0 like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions . 
0 the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
1 if you're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , enough is just the ticket you need . 
1  . . . a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet . 
0 starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
1 among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations . 
0 busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
1 although it's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do . 
1 the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . 
0 resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
0 has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 
0 charming , if overly complicated . . . 
1 that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed . 
0 despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
0 jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot . 
1 terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life . 
0 with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door . 
1 disturbing and brilliant documentary . 
1 quite funny for the type of movie it is . . . 
1 michael moore's latest documentary about america's thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . 
0 you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
0 when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . 
0 this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . 
0 although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
0 a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
1 a three-hour cinema master class . 
1 taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller . 
0 there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
1 the cat's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich . . . 
1 watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay's sappier elements . . . and sustains off the hook's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer . 
1 it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . 
1 a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction ! 
1 like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely . 
0 in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 
0 this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
1 tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth . 
0 the action clich�s just pile up . 
0 you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
1 a movie where story is almost an afterthought amidst a swirl of colors and inexplicable events . 
0  . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 . 
1 a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies . 
1 alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous . it's a masterpeice . 
1 a joyous occasion
1 this is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood . 
1 [woo's] most resonant film since the killer . 
0 the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
1 this is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style . 
0 the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
0 unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
1 it's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought . 
0 the script's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off . 
1 a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession � one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom . 
0 there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
1 the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on b�ttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history . 
0 it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
0 the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
1 its story about a young chinese woman , ah na , who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling . 
1 with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work . 
0 gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
1 the biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough . 
1 the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 
1 a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park's . 
0 it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons � a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
0 some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
0 it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
0 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
1 the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen . 
1 an animation landmark as monumental as disney's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs . 
0 in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of . . . outrageous gags . 
0 the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
0 god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse . 
1 a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea . 
1 true tale of courage -- and complicity -- at auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable . 
1 interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals 'red dragon' right from under their noses . 
1 chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer . 
0 a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective . 
1 definitely funny stuff , but it's more of the 'laughing at' variety than the 'laughing with . '
0 suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
0 the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
0 downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message . 
0 the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
1 a manically generous christmas vaudeville . 
0 it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
1 not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
1 the film starts out as competent but unremarkable . . . and gradually grows into something of considerable power . 
0 the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
0 the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . 
0 what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients . 
1 this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director . 
1 though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking . 
0 like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
0 a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
0 i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
1 a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch . 
1 a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness . 
1 high crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them , and maybe that is nobility of a sort . 
1 daughter from danang sticks with its subjects a little longer and tells a deeper story
0 purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
0 bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
0 what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
0 the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
1 like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film . 
1 you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll . 
0 boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
0 the master of disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy . 
1 i simply can't recommend it enough . 
0 manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
1  . . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor . 
0 what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
0 birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
1 confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk . 
1 it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn . 
0 an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
0 you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
1 like mike doesn't win any points for originality . it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism . 
0 the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
0 clever but not especially compelling . 
0 the film can depress you about life itself . 
1 bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie . . . is , also , frequently hilarious . 
0 a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
0 neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn . 
1 a compelling motion picture that illustrates an american tragedy . 
0 portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
1 an imaginative comedy/thriller . 
0 it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
1 robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favour of an altogether darker side . 
0 there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
1 not a strike against yang's similarly themed yi yi , but i found what time ? to be more engaging on an emotional level , funnier , and on the whole less detached . 
0 the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
0 the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
1 an ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it . 
0 contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom . 
1 as ex-marine walter , who may or may not have shot kennedy , actor raymond j . barry is perfectly creepy and believable . 
1 victor rosa is leguizamo's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance . 
0 the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
0 a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
0 plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
0 began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
0 glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
0 what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky . 
0 it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
0 all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
0 none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
0 newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept � a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
0 twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
1 a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
0 even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
1 this filmed tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it's filmed tosca that you want . i'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper . 
1 on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play . 
1 challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative . but it's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle . 
1 despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away . 
1 it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . 
0 i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
0 if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog . 
0 all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin . 
1 wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse . 
1 a memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill . 
0 perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
1 the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold . 
0 city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery .

0 the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
1 a vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition . 
1 hip-hop has a history , and it's a metaphor for this love story .

1 [washington's] strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene . 
0 the story has little wit and no surprises . 
1 ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum . 
0 at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects . 
1 a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs . 
0 the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
0 what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . 
0 witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic . 
0 a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 
0 hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story . 
1 insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . 
0 these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
0 the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john . 
1  . . . a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's . . . the film's ending has a " what was it all for ? " feeling to it , but like the 1920's , the trip there is a great deal of fun . 
0 though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
1 on the heels of the ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness . 
1 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity . 
1 by not averting his eyes , solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable .

0 teen movies have really hit the skids . 
0 i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
1 the story . . . is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band . 
0 if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
0 the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels . 
1 even in its most tedious scenes , russian ark is mesmerizing . 
1 has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre . 
0 innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
0 while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
1 while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving . 
1 finally , the french-produced " read my lips " is a movie that understands characters must come first . 
0 from the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line , " besotted " is misbegotten
1 meeting , even exceeding expectations , it's the best sequel since the empire strikes back . . . a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth . 
1 while somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out . 
0 cinematic poo . 
1 brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life's harshness . 
1 the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but � in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has � ironically - distanced us from the characters . 
1 solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts . 
1 pacino is the best he's been in years and keener is marvelous . 
1 not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it . 
1 it's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by kwan's unique directing style . 
0 i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
1 straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it . 
1  . . . as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the star wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement . 
0 the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place . 
0 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .

0 there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering . 
1 not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog . 
0 alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
0 it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
1 peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery
0 weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
0 even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
1 a thought-provoking and often-funny drama about isolation . 
0 the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
0 co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
0 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay .

1 one from the heart . 
1 a fascinating literary mystery story with multiple strands about the controversy of who really wrote shakespeare's plays . 
0 just not campy enough
0 it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
0 here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 
1 foster and whitaker are especially fine . she is a lioness , protecting her cub , and he a reluctant villain , incapable of controlling his crew . 
1 in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns . 
1 whether [binoche and magimel] are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria .

0 bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie . 
0 an often unfunny romp . 
0 i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
0 conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences . 
1 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer . 
1 so unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is . 
1 most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness . 
0 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
1 there are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why . 
1 unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such 'have-yourself-a-happy-little-holocaust' movies as life is beautiful and jakob the liar , the grey zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in auschwitz . 
1 it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
0 too clever by about nine-tenths . 
1 a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world . 
1 miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary . 
0 this film biggest problem ? no laughs . 
0 flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up .

1 but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it's about a very human one . 
1 hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation . 
1 its director's most substantial feature for some time . 
0 i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
1 earns its laughs from stock redneck 'types' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing . 
0 given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
1 he's the scariest guy you'll see all summer . 
0 like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
1  ( caine ) proves once again he hasn't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film . 
1 wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture . 
1 based on dave barry's popular book of the same name , the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters' moves and overlapping story . 
1 � uma pena que , mais tarde , o pr�prio filme abandone o tom de par�dia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clich�s que havia satirizado . 
1 these three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people . 
0 the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
0 the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake . 
0 ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
1 look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music . 
0 an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
0 the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) . 
1 day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs . 
0 a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
0 will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? 
0 the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
1 an example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship . 
1 hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie's political ramifications . 
1 the mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t . 
1 nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life . 
0 what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well , it's not as pathetic as the animal . 
1 some body will take you places you haven't been , and also places you have . 
0 in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little .

1 the humor and humanity of monsoon wedding are in perfect balance . 
1 foster breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill . 
0 has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags . 
1  . . . a solid , well-formed satire . 
1 it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
0 a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
1 while not as aggressively impressive as its american counterpart , " in the bedroom , " moretti's film makes its own , quieter observations
0 a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
0 the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
1 an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore . 
1  . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps . 
0 kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
1 nicholson's understated performance is wonderful . as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he's neglected over the years . 
0 is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
1 dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness ( which always relates to characters and story ) and johnny dankworth's best soundtrack in years . 
0 watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
1 a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past . 
0 fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
1 a lovely film . . . elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic . . . hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source's complexity . 
1 whether or not you're enlightened by any of derrida's lectures on " the other " and " the self , " derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow . 
1 a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship . 
1 neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway . 
1 you could love safe conduct ( laissez passer ) for being a subtitled french movie that is 170 minutes long . you could hate it for the same reason . 
1 a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama . 
0 the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
1  . . . wise and elegiac . . . 
1 a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment . 
1 what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera's attention to detail . 
1 although olivier assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation . . . its three-hour running time plays closer to two . 
0 a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 
1 the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life . 
1 brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life . 
1 [an] absorbing documentary .

1 a straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they've rarely been given . 
1 frida isn't that much different from many a hollywood romance . what sets it apart is the vision that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway's the lion king and the film titus , brings . 
0 what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . 
0 gets better after foster leaves that little room .

1 a refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale . 
0 attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
0 the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
0 the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
1 it's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear . 
0 something must have been lost in the translation . 
1 it is definitely worth seeing .

1 originality ain't on the menu , but there's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller . 
0 the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
1 o �ltimo suspeito ganha for�a ao tamb�m funcionar em uma esfera adicional : a do drama familiar .

0 [swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
1 the unexplored story opportunities of " punch-drunk love " may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson . 
1 the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life . 
0 with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
1 it's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again . 
1 jacquot's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances . . . while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself . 
1 it is ridiculous , of course . . . but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness . 
1 a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it . 
0 a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing .

0 watching queen of the damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in . 
0 let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
1 this new time machine is hardly perfect� yet it proves surprisingly serviceable . even at its worst , it's not half-bad . 
0 this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it can't really be called animation . 
0 an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
1 dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments . 
1 it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . 
1 it's jagger's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite . 
0 expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies . 
0 sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
0 the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
1 one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin . 
1 a poignant lyricism runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem . 
1 very well-written and very well-acted .

1  . . . fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film . 
0 whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars

0  . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
0 zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .

1 a film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities . 
0 the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
1 the entire cast is extraordinarily good . 
0 the cold turkey would've been a far better title . 
1 far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but more than that , it's a work of enthralling drama . 
1 a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it's potentially just as rewarding .

0  . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
1 it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons . 
0 literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
1 it leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors .

1 a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause . 
0 a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
0 an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
1 the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt's , no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale . 
1 bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted- from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen .

0 vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
0 rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .

0 drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story . 
0 it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
1 at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second . 
0 with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
0 plays like john le carr� with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
1 the film is insightful about kissinger's background and history . 
1 the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series . 
0 [allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
1 a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels . 
0 there's no question that epps scores once or twice , but it's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head . 
1 a minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera . . . 
1 a vivid , sometimes surreal , glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior . 
0  . . . they missed the boat . 
0 a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
1 a violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for angelique , the [opening] dance guarantees karmen's enthronement among the cinema's memorable women . 
1 this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers . 
1 it is great summer fun to watch arnold and his buddy gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters . 
1 it's no accident that the accidental spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form . 
0 although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
1 the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end . 
1 majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . 
1  . . . a lesson in prehistoric hilarity . 
0 though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
0 a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
1  . . . a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original . 
1 nicole holofcener's lovely and amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style . 
1 it is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish . 
0 though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
0 madonna still can't act a lick . 
0 far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
0 kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
1 a tremendous piece of work . 
0 the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
1 will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
0 the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
1 gloriously straight from the vagina . 
0 succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
0 a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
1 a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama . 
0 the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
0 problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
0 i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
1 the quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy . 
0 egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose . 
0 ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
1 a fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to betty fisher and left out the other stories . 
0 deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . 
0 bad and baffling from the get-go . 
0 it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit . 
0 more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
0 it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism . 
0 excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .

0 could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes . 
0 the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
1 what's not to like about a movie with a 'children's' song that includes the line 'my stepdad's not mean , he's just adjusting' ? 
0 handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffl� . 
0 a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
0 it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins . 
0 an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
0 calculated swill . 
1 manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it . 
0 the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
1 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff .

1 a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
0 it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
0 the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
1 sparkles in its deft portrait of tinseltown's seasoned veterans of gossip , wealth , paranoia , and celebrityhood . 
1 it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile . 
0 it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
1 others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating . 
1 a rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love . 
0 never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
0 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
0 overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
1 see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
1 earnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese . 
0 this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
1 none of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting isn't , either , and you wouldn't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ? 
1  . . . with the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself . 
1 digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world . 
1 the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable . 
0 boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
0 john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
1 road to perdition does display greatness , and it's worth seeing . but it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it's won . 
1 insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through . 
1 returning director rob minkoff . . . and screenwriter bruce joel rubin . . . have done a fine job of updating white's dry wit to a new age . 
1 it's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you don't try to look too deep into the story
1 as any creature-feature fan knows , when you cross toxic chemicals with a bunch of exotic creatures , you get a lot of running around , screaming and death . on that score , the film certainly doesn't disappoint . 
0 without shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish . 
0 as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west . 
1 a cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty . 
1 a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody . 
0 this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
0 might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
1 [hawn's character]is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten . 
0 american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new . 
1  with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness . 
1 an emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema . 
1 it is nature against progress . in fessenden's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale . 
1 without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions . 
0 this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
1 there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade . 
1 a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv's big brother . 
1 here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably . 
0 the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line . 
0 makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
1  " catch me " feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark . 
1  . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay . 
0 this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
1 'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director's cut . '
1 noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism . 
0 if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . 
0 the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
1 imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made . 
1 gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , [harris] brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging sandeman . 
0 it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
1 a tour de force drama about the astonishingly pivotal role of imagination in the soulful development of two rowdy teenagers . 
0 the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
1 the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert . 
0 the only thing " swept away " is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
0 a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
1 a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
0 britney spears' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction . 
0 as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
0 more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
0 just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
1 driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm . . . the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs .

1 it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
1 the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 
1 this isn't a stand up and cheer flick ; it's a sit down and ponder affair . and thanks to kline's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable .

1 one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .

0 merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense .

0 an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
1 an engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character . 
0 director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
1 troubling and powerful . 
0 the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
0 the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .

0 adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . 
1 a work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry . 
0 lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
0 were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '

0 laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany . 
0 a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop . 
0 the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
1 a sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , really isn't . 
0  " an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . " 
1 lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . 
1 if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time . 
0 the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
0 j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
1 one of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it . 
1 for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche . 
0 as happily glib and vicious as its characters . 
0 they should have called it gutterball . 
1 a worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions . 
0 i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
0  . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
0 high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
1 as satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago . . . has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency . 
1 probably the best case for christianity since chesterton and lewis . 
0 no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . 
1 the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
1 few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness . 
0 an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
1 it's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world . 
1 you're not merely watching history , you're engulfed by it . 
0 in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
0 despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
1 spielberg has managed to marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks with philosophical inquiry . 
1 what could have easily become a cold , calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking . 
1 if the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well . 
0 sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
1 it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look . 
1 writer/director david caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza . 
1 significantly better than its 2002 children's-movie competition . 
1 some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options . 
0 kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles . 
1 the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and . . . often misconstrued as weakness . 
1 japanese director shohei imamura's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime . 
1 both heartbreaking and heartwarming . . . just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it's tremendously moving . 
1 the sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack . 
0 i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
1 a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy . 
0 burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
0 an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
1 a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes , but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two
1 sweet home alabama isn't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts . 
1 a film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story . 
1 russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage . 
1 a flawed but engrossing thriller . 
1 definitely worth 95 minutes of your time .

0 more of a career curio than a major work . 
0 the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental . 
1 the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family . 
1 one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece . 
0  . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
1 if you've the patience , there are great rewards here . 
0 the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
1 aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it . 
0 the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
0 will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
0 it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
0 occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma . 
0 i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
1 dog soldiers doesn't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it . 
1 though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them . 
0 it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
1 it is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise . 
1 the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins . 
1 this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory . the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens . 
0 a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
1 it's the perfect star vehicle for grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona . 
0 the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
1 finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less . 
1 a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . 
1 one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism . 
1 as played by ryan gosling , danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction .

0 a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
1 poignant japanese epic about adolescent anomie and heartbreak . 
1 keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s . c . , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner .

1 meyjes . . . has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics .

0 if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
0 this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
1 if the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in�and making you sweat . 
1 what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman's tragic odyssey . 
0 the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
0 while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
0 it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
0 all mood and no movie . 
0 much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here . 
1 there's plenty to impress about e . t . 
1 writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . 
1 highly engaging . 
0 obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
1 a charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind . 
1 cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces . 
1 an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story . 
1 it's fascinating to see how bettany and mcdowell play off each other . 
0 comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
0 less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle . 
0 none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
0 sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth . 
0 did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
0 there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
0 only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . 
1  . . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . 
1 as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , 'lovely ! brilliant ! '
0 after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 
1 promises is one film that's truly deserving of its oscar nomination . 
1 a keep-'em-guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters . 
1 a real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us don't know . 
1 i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 
1 the paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final ( restored ) third�emotionally belittle a cinema classic . sometimes shorter is better . 
0 swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
1 imagine o . henry's <b>the gift of the magi</b> relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of nyc's drug scene . merry friggin' christmas ! 
1 for the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera . 
0 mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
1 hatosy . . . portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue . 
0 mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
0 a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
0 what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
0 the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 
0 the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
1 this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences . . . and it's all the stronger because of it . 
0 this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
0 who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like " they're back ! " , " they're out there ! " and " they're coming ! " 
0 what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 
0 the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '
0 its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
0 the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
1 i was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon . 
1 turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
1 the writing is clever and the cast is appealing . 
0 the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller . 
1 cube's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche . 
1 this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep . 
1 we get an image of big papa spanning history , rather than suspending it . 
0 sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
1 it's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable . 
0 pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 
1 [the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together . 
1 as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys' novel " the death of napoleon " and directed by alan taylor , napoleon's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn
0 so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
1 lan yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree . 
0 the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
1 the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs . 
0 moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured . 
0 the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
1 it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements . 
0 the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
1 a gem of a movie . 
0 if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
0 dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
0 sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
0 for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
1 it's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original . 
1 all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
1 it's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak . but what spectacular sizzle it is ! . . . in this incarnation its fizz is infectious . 
1 a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women . 
0 big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
0 viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess . 
1 what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish . 
1 a fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction . 
0 brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 
1  . . . there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen . 
1 although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . 
1 humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath's version of 'nicholas nickleby' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful . not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days . 
0 it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 . 
1 a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 
1  " mr . deeds " is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . 
1 the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise . 
0 i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
1 the dangerous lives of altar boys' take on adolescence feels painfully true . 
0 even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . 
1 spare but quietly effective retelling . 
0 in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
0 the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
0 succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
0 the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
1 a bittersweet film , simple in form but rich with human events . 
0 what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
1 here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 
0 credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
0 the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned .

0 the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
1 a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale . 
0 the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
0 worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
0 characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
1 franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic . 
1 overall , it's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love . 
1 nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . 
0 there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
1 the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a " dungeons and dragons " fantasy with modern military weaponry . . . 
0 this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmm�might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
1 an ambitious 'what if ? ' that works . 
1 i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound . 
0 the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ? 
0 once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
1 very predictable but still entertaining
1 the most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any " jackass " fan could want . 
1 funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic . 
1 seeing seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but . 
1 manages to be wholesome and subversive at the same time . 
0 while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . " 
1 an escapist confection that's pure entertainment . 
1 the film doesn't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half
0 if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
1 combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration . 
0 crudup's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families . 
1 exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . 
0 like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
0 green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
0 rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
0 it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . 
1 all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure . 
0 do you say " hi " to your lover when you wake up in the morning ? 
1 there is a general air of exuberance in all about the benjamins that's hard to resist . 
0 sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
0 based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
1 becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters . 
0 affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that ford effortlessly filled with authority . 
1 a miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out
1 all three women deliver remarkable performances . 
1 it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ? 
1 that death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world's religions . this deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications . 
1 broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary . he thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject . 
1 this isn't a narrative film -- i don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come . 
1 now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism . 
0 yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
0 when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
0 the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
1 the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time . 
1 a gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn jerusalem . 
0 what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
1 [scherfig] has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters' lives after the clever credits roll . 
0 one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . 
0 seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
1 as a director , mr . ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects . 
1  . . . a fairly disposable yet still entertaining b picture . 
1 my wife is an actress works as well as it does because [the leads] are such a companionable couple . 
1 it's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech . 
0 it drowns in sap . 
0 never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 
0 a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
1 it's quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer . 
0 this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
1 what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material . 
0 an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
0 elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
0 more trifle than triumph . 
0 the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
0 even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
1 it's one heck of a character study -- not of hearst or davies but of the unique relationship between them . 
0 apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
1 it might be tempting to regard mr . andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr . earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists . 
1 smith profiles five extraordinary american homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities . 
1 it's unlikely we'll see a better thriller this year . 
0 it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
0 a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
1 [there's] quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin . 
1 shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski's the pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high . 
1 [ferrera] has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen . 
0 it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
0 the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
1 disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself . 
0 do not see this film . 
0 the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
0 not exactly the bees knees
0 at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
0 while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
1 the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once . the extent to which it succeeds is impressive . 
0 the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
0 looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito's way . 
0 some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 
1 is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief . 
0 a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
1 it's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today . 
1 though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions . 
0 judd's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller smart women , foolish choices for advice . 
1  . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic . 
0 many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
1 it strikes hardest when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 
0 the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
0 the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
0 stale and clich�d to a fault . 
1 uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year . 
0 rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . 
0 unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
1 it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
1 goes a long way on hedonistic gusto . 
1 highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it . 
1 parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness . 
1 in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel . but in imax 3-d , the clich�s disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography . 
1 plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision . 
1 there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2--quite a rarity , even in the family film market . eventually , it wins you over . 
1 has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of b-movie excitement . 
0 interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
1 an enthralling , entertaining feature . 
1 another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre . 
1 the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 
0 for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one . 
1 that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . 
1 as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits . 
0 the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
1 a little better than sorcerer's stone . 
0 a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 
0 the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . 
0 the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
1 while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem . 
1 the film has a terrific look and salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life . 
0 it's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
1 this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be . 
1 both flawed and delayed , martin scorcese's gangs of new york still emerges as his most vital work since goodfellas . 
0 there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
1 this is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but ayres makes the right choices at every turn . 
0 the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? '
1 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch . 
0 fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
1 washington overcomes the script's flaws and envelops the audience in his character's anguish , anger and frustration . 
1  . . . even if you've never heard of chaplin , you'll still be glued to the screen . 
0 needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
0 wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime . 
0 a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
1 fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense . 
0 it's fitfully funny but never really takes off . 
1 a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass . 
1 just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever . 
0 the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
1 though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
1 like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel . 
1 there are just enough twists in the tale to make it far more satisfying than almost any horror film in recent memory . 
1 the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies . 
0 the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
1 leigh makes these lives count . and he allows a gawky actor like spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range . 
0 terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . 
0 this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
0 if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , " rollerball " 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j . 
0 a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick . 
0 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
0 there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
0 only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 
1 insanely hilarious ! i haven't laughed that hard in years ! 
0 it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
0 an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
0 i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered . 
0 it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
0 this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
0 the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe . 
1 that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it . 
0 as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile . 
0 throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
1 could have been crisper and punchier , but it's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies . 
1 there's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl . 
1 majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast . 
0 credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
1 there's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm . 
0 while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
1 an old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue . 
0 a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks . 
1 the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers . 
0 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
1 a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know . 
0 has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 
1 transforms one of [shakespeare's] deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy . 
0 a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
0 neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
0 the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . 
0 diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
0 [lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 
1 a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats . 
1 a winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others . 
0 ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
1 evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes . 
0 what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
0 a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
0 to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
1 the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport . 
0 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
1 [raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see . 
1 jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers . 
0 starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
0 it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
1 evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children--and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good . 
1 although the editing might have been tighter , hush ! sympathetically captures the often futile lifestyle of young people in modern japan . 
0 it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . 
0 un thriller manqu� qui tombe sur les nerfs presque d�s la premi�re image . 
1 you've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it's worth yet another visit . 
1 my thoughts were focused on the characters . that is a compliment to kuras and miller . if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong . 
0 the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
1 yakusho and shimizu . . . create engaging characterizations in imamura's lively and enjoyable cultural mix . 
1 does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets . 
1 it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 
1 laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
1 hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 
0 report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
1 pray has really done his subject justice . 
0 [taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
0 demme's loose approach kills the suspense . 
0 it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
0 the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
1 the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre . 
0 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
0 exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
0 watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
1 as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled ( literally and figuratively ) by desire . . . [sex and luc�a] makes for an arousing good time . 
1 it may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate . 
1 this is as respectful a film as byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary . 
0 with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . 
0 slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
1 although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun . 
0 a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
0 the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
0 has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
0  . . . generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish . 
1 hey , happy ! is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it's a love story as sanguine as its title . 
1 it's a talking head documentary , but a great one . 
0 fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .

1 eight legged freaks is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and leaves you feeling like you've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer . 
0 borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
0 the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
1 visually fascinating . . . an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
1 bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys . 
1 argento , at only 26 , brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock . 
1 both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right . 
0 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
1 manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state . 
1 the most compelling wiseman epic of recent years . 
1 the performances are an absolute joy . 
0 schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression . 
0 it's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . 
0 there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
1 doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere . 
1 the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style . the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
1 muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have , and how this gets us in trouble . but even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic .

1 top-notch action powers this romantic drama . 
0 while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby's main overall flaw . 
1 it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years . 
0 the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
0 solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me .

0 your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
0 despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
1 the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end . 
1  . . . the implication is kissinger may have decided that when it comes to truncheoning it's better to give than to receive . 
1 an infinitely wittier version of the home alone formula . 
0 with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins . 
1 undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos . 
0 what an embarrassment . 
0 barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .

0 nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
0 it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
0 when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ? 
0 although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless �70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
1 led by griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material . 
1 the fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad . 
0 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
1 adam sandler ! in an art film ! 
1 functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing . 
1 lovely and poignant . puts a human face on a land most westerners are unfamiliar with . 
1 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor . 
1 like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever . 
0 a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
0 i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
0 you . . . get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . 
1 highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
1 despite its flaws , crazy as hell marks an encouraging new direction for la salle . 
0 an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
1 a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile . 
1 director chris wedge and screenwriters michael berg , michael j . wilson and peter ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time . 
1 the increasingly diverse french director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history . 
1 amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than barbershop .

0 the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension . 
1 it's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash . , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it's what makes their project so interesting . 
1 those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them . 
1 good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat . 
0 broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
0 a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
0 a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .

1 all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon . 
0 if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
0 its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? 
1 filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home .

1 one of the more intelligent children's movies to hit theaters this year . 
1 hard to resist . 
1 a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism . 
0 there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
1 you should pay nine bucks for this : because you can hear about suffering afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected . dramas like this make it human . 
0 it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
1 it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 
1 a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well . 
0 sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
0 the comedy is nonexistent .

1 against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine . 
0 a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 
0 a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
1 like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting . 
0 would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
0 the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works . 
0 the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .

0 eh . 
0 the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .

1 a family film that contains some hefty thematic material on time , death , eternity , and what is needed to live a rich and full life . 
1 [russell] makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards . 
1 as it turns out , you can go home again . 
1 a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience . 
1 it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity . 
1 time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
0 the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
0 befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
0 has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
1 the movie sticks much closer to hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did .

0 two hours of junk . 
1 a melancholy , emotional film . 
1 this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire . 
0 the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
1 it's the kind of movie that , aside from robert altman , spike lee , the coen brothers and a few others , our moviemakers don't make often enough . 
0 the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
0 how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
1 shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .

0 like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party . 
0 nearly every attempt at humor here is doa . 
1 a seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by georgian-israeli director dover kosashvili . 
1 wiseman reveals the victims of domestic abuse in all of their pity and terror . 
0 dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
1 the fourth " pokemon " is a diverting--if predictable--adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world's delicate ecological balance . 
0 it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
1 a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race . 
1 but tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde's droll whimsy helps " being earnest " overcome its weaknesses and parker's creative interference . . . 
0 this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
0 the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
0 just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
1 [a] thoughtful , visually graceful work . 
0 it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
0 high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
0 a generic international version of a typical american horror film . 
1 griffiths proves she's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession .

0 shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . 
0 [t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
0 the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither . 
0 i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed .

0 the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
1 old people will love this movie , and i mean that in the nicest possible way : last orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship . 
0 here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better .

1 mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt . 
0 what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
0 a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
0 meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 
1 a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers . . . 
1 it never fails to engage us . 
0 the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
1 this insightful , oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance . 
1 a simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm . 
1 a droll , bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small-town pretension in the lone star state .

1 an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see . 
1 it doesn't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one's imagination will lead when given the opportunity . 
1 grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte . 
1 it shows us a slice of life that's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable . 
0 deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
0 bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
1 leading a double life in an american film only comes to no good , but not here . matters play out realistically if not always fairly . 
1 'they' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying i'm still stunned . and i've decided to leave a light on every night from now on . 
0 this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
1 escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions . 
0 kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both .

0 by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 
1 a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 
0 as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all . 
1 aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better . 
0 glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum . 
1 as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records . 
1 if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that . 
1 a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith's next movie . 
1 entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together . 
1  . . . a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs . it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
1 an entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie . 
1 a movie i loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance . 
0 the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
1 more honest about alzheimer's disease , i think , than iris . 
1 evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking . 
1 an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to . 
1 it's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that doesn't feel it has to prove anything . 
1 so beautifully acted and directed , it's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses . 
0 this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . 
1 it's a glorious spectacle like those d . w . griffith made in the early days of silent film . 
1 not as well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted . 
0 totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
0 stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
1 one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense . 
0 i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible ! 
1 marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film . 
0 a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
1 purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro . 
0 lacks depth . 
1 francophiles will snicker knowingly and you'll want to slap them . 
1 steven soderbergh's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life . 
0 it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . 
0  " what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it , " one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia . 
0 the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections . 
1 it's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it's brilliant . 
1 richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings . 
0 we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
1 an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
1 at its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating . 
0 his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
0 an opportunity missed . 
0 the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
1 poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 
1 a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
0 an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
1 has a lot of the virtues of eastwood at his best . 
1 do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman doesn't work ? 
0 begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
1 it's secondary to american psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours . 
0 an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
1 a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it . 
1 it has a way of seeping into your consciousness , with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at . 
0  . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
1 the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task .

1 skip work to see it at the first opportunity . 
1 the wonder of mostly martha is the performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing . 
0 these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
0 the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
0 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
0 an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
1 beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes . 
1 an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson . 
0 this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer . 
1 as shaky as the plot is , kaufman's script is still memorable for some great one-liners . 
0 bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad .

1 thanks to scott's charismatic roger and eisenberg's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men . 
1 if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones' diary or high fidelity , then you won't want to miss about a boy . 
1 the case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause . 
1 if you open yourself up to mr . reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set . . . it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change . 
0 a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
0 a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
0 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra . 
1 not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics . 
0 a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
0 if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .

0 to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
0 sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
1 the creative animation work may not look as fully 'rendered' as pixar's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree .

0 it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
1 campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael's evolution . 
0 rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . 
0 in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . 
1 if you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , sweet home alabama is diverting in the manner of jeff foxworthy's stand-up act . 
1 a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives . 
0  . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad .

1 a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
1 nettelbeck . . . has a pleasing way with a metaphor . 
1 it celebrates the group's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his 'angels of light . '
0 frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes . 
0 things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content . 
1 the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago . 
1 it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works . 
0 the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
1 superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line . 
1 an asian neo-realist treasure . 
0 the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .

1 [a] smarter and much funnier version of the old police academy flicks . 
1 combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why didn't hollywood think of this sooner ? 
1 inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
1 a riveting documentary . 
1 despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it . 
0 a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
1 el peso de un l�quido incoloro , el peso del l�quido vital , del amor como elemento de vida , y de muerte . . .

1 with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , h�l�ne angel is definitely a director to watch .

0 interesting , but not compelling . 
1 cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days
1 while this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience .

0 the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
1 what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is .

1 a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage " be careful what you wish for " is given a full workout . 
0 summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this .

1 a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . 
1 an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist .

1 wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film . 
1 a potent allegorical love story . 
0 there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them . 
1 by no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story .

1 'alice's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie-land' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures .

0 the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .

1 ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film . 
1 working from elliott's memoir , rohmer fashions the sort of delicate , articulate character- and- relationship study he's favored for decades . 
1 bogdanovich puts history in perspective and , via kirsten dunst's remarkable performance , he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy . 
0 godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
1 to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it's thanks to huston's revelatory performance . 
1 as relationships shift , director robert j . siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc .

1 while the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo . . . broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity . 
0 a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
0 an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 
0 a humorless journey into a philosophical void . 
1 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies . 
0 potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
1 not since tom cruise in risky business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear . 
0 uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
0 shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
0 though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
0 some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
1 some actors have so much charisma that you'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book . hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors . 
0 mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
0 proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . 
0 it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .

0 [a] slummer . 
0 a sudsy cautionary tale . 
1 streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , " big trouble " is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter . 
0 supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
0  . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
1 the film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end . 
1 a very pretty after-school special . it's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it .

1 the next generation of mob movie . part low rent godfather . part three stooges . 
0 a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
1 the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react . 
0 broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
0 it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
1 almost peerlessly unsettling . 
1 a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
1 the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic . 
1 predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell . 
1 a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
0 it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? " 
1 if you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then triple x marks the spot . 
1 just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . 
0 the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot . 
1 one of the most original american productions this year , you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state . 
0 this is no " waterboy ! " 
1 the long-range appeal of " minority report " should transcend any awards it bags . this is one for the ages . 
1 [a] devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama . 
0 the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
1 frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing . 
1 every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you're on the edge of your seat . 
1 it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space . 
0 collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly .

1 there are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front . 
0 unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
0 dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy .

0 nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
0 works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
1 the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it . 
0 with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
0 in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a r�sum� loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . " 
0 propelled not by characters but by caricatures . 
0 a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
0 a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
1 so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality . 
0 an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen . 
1 a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children's television .

1 gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways . 
0 the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
1 the film's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth . 
0 plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
0 the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .

0 johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
0 even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
0 there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
1 this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 
0 romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
0 maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .

1 charles' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams' attempts to get his shot at the big time . 
0 most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
1 she's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations .

0 under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
0 for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
1 romanek's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures . 
0  . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
1 by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , [jones] calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity .

0 for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .

0 a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
1 this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences . 
1 both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others . 
1 may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman . 
1 although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs .

0 swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 
1 a movie with a real anarchic flair . 
0 this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . 
1 writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured . 
0 watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . 
0 however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
0 slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
1 this is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light ( yet unsentimental ) touch . 
0 say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
1 jae-eun jeong's take care of my cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the south korean cinema .

1 longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days . 
1 light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful insurrection . which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors . 
1 this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem . 
0 a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
0 an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
0 calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
0 this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better . 
1 coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes . 
0 cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility . 
0 to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable . 
1 i have a confession to make : i didn't particularly like e . t . the first time i saw it as a young boy . that is because - damn it ! - i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
0 burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
0 the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either . 
1 it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
1 like the best of godard's movies . . . it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable . 
0 the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down . 
1 cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement . 
0 outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
0 instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
0 lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
1 there are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but brown sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy . 
1 a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python's meaning of life . 
0 rather less than the sum of its underventilated p�re-fils confrontations . 
0 it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
0 though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
1  . . . a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing . 
1 scherfig's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky . 
0 shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
1 steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it . but he somehow pulls it off . 
1 [reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch .

1 a french film with a more down-home flavor . 
1 tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances . 
0 life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities . 
0 jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 
1 when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily . 
0 the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
0 it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions . 
1 with a large cast representing a broad cross-section , tavernier's film bounds along with the rat-a-tat energy of " his girl friday , " maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes . 
1 on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique . 
0 if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother .

1 this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man . 
0 one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
1 mostly martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it's a pleasurable trifle . the only pain you'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub . 
0 while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
1 martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more .

1 starts slowly , but adrien brody � in the title role � helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying . 
1 if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then esther's story is a compelling quest for truth .

1 a classy , sprightly spin on film . 
1 worse than 'silence of the lambs' better than 'hannibal'
0 a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .

1 using an endearing cast , writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred . 
0 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
1 while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls can't swim . 
1 the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them . 
1  . . . digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations . 
0 it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
0 this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
1 you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid .

1 [hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo . 
1 highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager . 
0 the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .

0 cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy .

1 a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material . 
1 ' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
0 for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash . 
1 it works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory . 
0 further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . 
0 its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
0 instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
0 it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
1 more concerned with sade's ideas than with his actions . the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as . . . [quills] did by showing them .

0 one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
1 preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment . 
0 none of this is very original , and it isn't particularly funny . 
1 like smoke signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama
1 upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 
1 i had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was earnest . 
0 just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
0 the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired .

1 terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
0 what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .

1 secretary is just too original to be ignored . 
1 skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults .

1 an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans . 
1 it's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul . 
0 the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video .

0 opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
1 lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 
0 too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . 
1 nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects .

1 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another . 
1 without resorting to camp or parody , haynes ( like sirk , but differently ) has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange .

1 good ol' urban legend stuff .

0 the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
0 though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
0 what's next : " my mother the car ? " 
0 the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .

1 despite these annoyances , the capable clayburgh and tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age . 
1 although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious . 
1 doesn't do more than expand a tv show to movie length . however , it's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome . 
1  " spider-man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer , and hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff . if you're a comic fan , you can't miss it . if you're not , you'll still have a good time . "

0 a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . 
1 the draw [for " big bad love " ] is a solid performance by arliss howard . 
1 what's infuriating about full frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense . what's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn . 
0 it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
0 as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
0 [serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
0 the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
1 haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed .

1 though nijinsky's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature . 
1 because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin . 
0 been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
0 after a while , hoffman's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial .

1 it's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru .

0 enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
1 'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . 
1 a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures .

0  . . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats . 
1 with each of her three protagonists , miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path . 
1 it represents better-than-average movie-making that doesn't demand a dumb , distracted audience . 
0 a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad .

1 a loving little film of considerable appeal . 
0 it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
0 an empty , purposeless exercise . 
0 it's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure . 
0 something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
0 well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
0 the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
1 ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible . 
1 where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 
0 an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
0 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
1 as a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , sex with strangers is a success . 
0 writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
0 when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
0 jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company . 
0 an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character . 
1 the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
1  . . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games . 
1 me without you has a bracing truth that's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood . 
0 a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
1 splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity . 
1 the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining . 
0 a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
1 smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise . 
0 a well-crafted letdown . 
0 a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
0 reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
0 amazingly dopey . 
0 what little grace [rifkin's] tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics . 
0 the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious . 
1 'easily my choice for one of the year's best films . '
1 clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up . 
1 the early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us . this is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one . it's sort of in-between , and it works . 
1 it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . 
0 the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
0 plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
1 holm does his sly , intricate magic , and iben hjelje is entirely appealing as pumpkin . 
1 while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort . 
0 it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
1 if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror . 
0 this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
1 long after you leave justine , you'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean . 
1 the film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson . . . 
1 boisterous and daft documentary . 
0 makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
0 the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
0 it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
1 she's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness . 
1 a swashbuckling tale of love , betrayal , revenge and above all , faith . 
0 the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
0 benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
1 a treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you're a struggling nobody . 
0 no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
1 the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation . 
1 sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people . 
0 'the ch�teau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
1 executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond . 
0 the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
0 when the fire burns out , we've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that's where the film ultimately fails . 
1 one of the best rock documentaries ever . wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many . 
1 mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun . 
1 much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 
1 both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ? may prove to be [tsai's] masterpiece . 
0 dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
1 i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind . 
1 suffers from its timid parsing of the barn-side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers . 
0 watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures . 
1  . . . breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters . 
1 [kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it . 
1 the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 
1 one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning . 
1 cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want . . . but it's still damn funny stuff . 
0  . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
0 put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
0 shrewd but pointless . 
0 it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
0 a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
1 succeeds only because bullock and grant were made to share the silver screen . 
1 an uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , the grey zone does have a center , though a morbid one . 
0 loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
1 [sports] admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency . 
0 with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
0 we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
0 what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy . 
0 hollywood ending just isn't very funny . 
1 a conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man's right to raise his own children . 
1 scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
1 an undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band . 
0 wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
0 instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized . 
0 the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
0 bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
1 the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
0 coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
1 may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow . 
1 [taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion . 
0 starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . 
0 i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
0 better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
1 i'd rather watch a rerun of the powerpuff girls
1 [breheny's] lensing of the new zealand and cook island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people . 
1 greg kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior . 
0 feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
0 completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
1 wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too . 
1 visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it's the very definition of epic adventure . 
0 lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . 
1 a grittily beautiful film that looks , sounds , and feels more like an extended , open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story . 
0 it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
1 if a horror movie's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well . . . a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride . 
0 mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .

1 a fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age . 
1 massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history . 
1 represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging indian american cinema . 
0  " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
1 in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters � damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 
0 frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
0 hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 
1 more vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it's inoffensive and actually rather sweet . 
1 it's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas . 
1 a gorgeous , witty , seductive movie . 
0 this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar . 
0 i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
0 despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off

0 once one experiences mr . haneke's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one's mouth , and little else . 
1 a quirky comedy set in newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that's so prevalent on the rock . 
1 if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing . 
0 rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . 
0 interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . 
0 a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
0 is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ? 
0 there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
1 the dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen . 
0 the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
1 sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to frida kahlo as if her life did , too . 
1 fairy-tale formula , serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , comedy , direction and especially charm . 
1 this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it . 
1 throughout , mr . audiard's direction is fluid and quick . 
0 ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
0 although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
0 a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to . 
0 it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich�s the filmmakers could dredge up . 
0 the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
0 worthy of the gong . 
1 reminiscent of alfred hitchcock's thrillers , most of the scary parts in 'signs' occur while waiting for things to happen . 
1 it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you . 
0 despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
1 as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . 
1 this harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked . 
1 despite besson's high-profile name being wasabi's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone . 
0 robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
1 a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord . 
1 rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle
0 the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team . 
0 it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
0 a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
0 van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
1 chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america . 
0 mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
0 just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 
0 offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
0 everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
0 never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . " 
1 a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking . 
0 it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
1 a brilliant , absurd collection of vignettes that , in their own idiosyncratic way , sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium . 
1 a sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in renaissance spain , and the fact that it's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling . 
0 although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
0 decent but dull . 
1 what's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children . 
0 a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
0 not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through . 
1 perhaps the grossest movie ever made . funny , though . 
0 an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
0 despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
1 hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue . 
0 an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
1  . . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind . 
1 an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment .

0 peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
0 violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 
0 weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes .

1 the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
0 [johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 
0 a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
1 spy kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : it actually improves upon the original hit movie . 
0 a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
1 byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama . 
1 eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters . 
0 like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
1 all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us . 
1 intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed . 
1 how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . 
1 a sly game of cat and mouse that's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances . 
0 instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust . 
1 hits one out of the park for the 'they don't make 'em like that anymore' department . 
1 for more than two decades mr . nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity . 
1 lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth . 
0 it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
0 essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
0 this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
1 if there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid . 
1 waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself . 
1 it's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me , but there's stuff here to like . 
0 dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
0 too silly to take seriously . 
1  . . . hits every cliche we've come to expect , including the assumption that " crazy " people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny . 
0 [morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism . 
0 it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting . 
0 the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
1 adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel . 
1 the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon . 
0 perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
0 a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
1 crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half . 
0 `hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere . 
1 painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances . 
1 sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
1 it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts . 
1 the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people . 
0 ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
0 a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . 
0 has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd . 
0 what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
1 an ambitious and moving but bleak film . 
0 the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
1 the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her . 
1 it's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it's also pretty funny . 
1 this new zealand coming-of-age movie isn't really about anything . when it's this rich and luscious , who cares ? 
0 it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
1 a sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters . 
1 hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . 
1 an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career . 
1 divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances . 
1 it's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful . 
0 director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
0 even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
1 this is not chabrol's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer . 
0 despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum . 
1 reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success . he's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness . 
1 you won't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies . 
1  . . . blade ii is more enjoyable than the original . 
1 a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination . 
1 a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts . 
1 by no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one . 
0 anemic , pretentious . 
1 at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do . 
0 sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
0 a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 
0 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
0 ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 
1 not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen . this isn't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend . 
1 the best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates . 
0 reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
1 the actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script's bad ideas and awkwardness . 
1 for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars . 
0 can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 
0 has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
1 there aren't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but " elling " manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year's most enjoyable releases . 
0 despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
1 a stylish thriller . 
1 the setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of " intacto's " dangerous and seductively stylish game . 
1 the new guy does have a heart . now , if it only had a brain . 
1 thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout . 
1 this familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences , though it's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times . 
0 an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
1 very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both . 
0 it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
0 afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
0 slick piece of cross-promotion . 
1 it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i can't wait for the sequel . 
1 never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches . . . gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving . 
0 at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
0 too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
0 davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
1 if you can push on through the slow spots , you'll be rewarded with some fine acting . 
0 does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
1 will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it . 
1 a perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy . 
1 as gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting . 
1 the off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery . 
0 a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
1 at its best ( and it does have some very funny sequences ) looking for leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be . 
1 if not a home run , then at least a solid base hit . 
1 mr . spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned . and they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor . 
1 the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense . 
1 it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good . 
1 a good thriller . 
1 smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . 
0 for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
0 as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
0 unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
1 continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means . 
0 green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . 
1 escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie . 
1 it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
1 until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity . 
0 oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring . 
0 it's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill . 
0 it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
0 the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
0 when mr . hundert tells us in his narration that 'this is a story without surprises , ' we nod in agreement . 
1 the most wondrous love story in years , it is a great film . 
0 it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
0 like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q . is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause . 
1 together writer-director danny verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . 
1 about as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come . 
1 jones . . . makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $1 . 8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart . 
0 the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
0 in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
0 i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid . 
1 ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis . 
0 it's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller . 
1 [lawrence bounces] all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place . 
0 a grating , emaciated flick . 
1 the best comedy concert movie i've seen since cho's previous concert comedy film , i'm the one that i want , in 2000 . 
0 the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
0 would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility . 
1 sorvino is delightful in the central role . she nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 
0 ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
1 stanley kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe . 
0 a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
0 well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy . 
1 morvern rocks . 
0 feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
1 would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
1 this ready-made midnight movie probably won't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun . 
0 what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
1 the movie's seams may show . . . but pellington gives " mothman " an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling . 
1 if there's one big point to promises , it's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other . 
1 offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere . 
0 go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
0 the impulses that produced this project . . . are commendable , but the results are uneven . 
1 grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length
1 it's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave . 
0 it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
0 dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
0 this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
1 it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . 
1 light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . 
1 not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters . 
1 a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd . 
0 suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
1 a timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices . 
0 there isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . 
1 a pretty decent kid-pleasing , tolerable-to-adults lark of a movie . 
1 much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . 
1 finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original . 
0 'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
0 a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . 
1  . . . spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative . 
0 shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
1 a fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion . 
0 with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
0 it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
0 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
0 the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
0 is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
0 hey arnold ! the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing . 
0 'the war of the roses , ' trailer-trash style . entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel . 
0 has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
0 it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
0 lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
0 tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
1 it's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor . 
0 [a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
1 an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick . 
1 to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
1 knows how to make our imagination wonder . 
1 secretary " is owned by its costars , spader and gyllenhaal . maggie g . makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen . 
1 rarely have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart . 
1 a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair's film is an absolute delight for all audiences . 
0 the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
0 one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
0 unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
0 it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
0 a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
0 lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s . 
0 this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september . 
1  . . . understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation . 
0 why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one . 
1 some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and heaven is one such beast . 
1 the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime . 
0 the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
1 manages to delight without much of a story . 
0 feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
0 each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
0 whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
0 plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
1 as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good . 
1 the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times . 
0 this is really just another genre picture . 
1 miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers . 
1 like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
0 a slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise . 
1 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
0 home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
0 murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
0 demands too much of most viewers . 
0 yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
1 when it really counts . . . bloody sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language . 
0 crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
1 it's definitely a step in the right direction . 
1 a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place . 
1 all in all , it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own . 
0 leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
1 by its modest , straight-ahead standards , undisputed scores a direct hit . 
1 unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners . 
1 not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . 
1 for once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . 
1 the beauty of alexander payne's ode to the everyman is in the details . 
1 alain choquart's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating . 
1 showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation . 
1 nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year . 
1 worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
1 allen se atreve a atacar , a atacarse y nos ofrece gags que van de la sonrisa a la risa de larga duraci�n
1 a delightful coming-of-age story . 
1 khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum . 
1 there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 . 
1 thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances , the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods . 
1 human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better . it's haunting . it's like a poem . 
1 it's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the marks family . 
1 hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic . 
0 the hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone . 
0 the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
1 the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . the performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie . 
1 probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent . 
0 on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xfl . 
0 despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another . 
1 in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage . 
0 historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . 
1 the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics . 
1 what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 
0 comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
0 the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died . 
1 it is quite a vision . 
0 the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
0 a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
1 the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
0 it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
0 i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
1 the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in 'baran . '
1  . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . . 
0 ' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '
1 an engrossing iranian film about two itinerant teachers and some lost and desolate people they encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed . 
0 a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
0 it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
0 there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
1 a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy . 
0 as vulgar as it is banal . 
0 despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book . 
1 witty dialog between realistic characters showing honest emotions . it's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor . like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs . 
0 a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
0 gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
0 ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
0 it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 
1 this often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal . 
1 never once predictable . 
0 not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well . 
0 this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
1 whatever complaints i might have , i'd take [its] earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor's club any time . 
0 in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 
1 the real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it's really well directed . 
0 while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
0 verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies . 
0 the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
0 this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
1 much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever . 
0 uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
0 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
1 though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl , rain is the far superior film . 
1 a stirring road movie . 
0 a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
0 where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
0 pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
0 much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad . 
0 from beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film . 
1 it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia . 
1  " 13 conversations " holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point . 
0 these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
1 fierce , glaring and unforgettable . 
0 a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
0 not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
1 engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship . 
1 the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work . 
0 a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
1 a brutally dry satire of middle american numbness . 
0 resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year . 
0 a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . 
0 morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he's taken one of the world's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating . 
0 stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text � when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
1 weird . rewarding . 
0 the only time 8 crazy nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers . 
0 the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
1 cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing . 
1 a slick , skillful little horror film . 
0 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke . 
0 a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
1 creeps you out in high style , even if nakata did it better . 
1 alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie . . . tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life . 
1 a well-executed spy-thriller . 
1 it's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but . 
1 o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing . 
1 there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises . 
0 a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
1 credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic . 
1 this is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies . 
1 it's rare to find a film to which the adjective 'gentle' applies , but the word perfectly describes pauline & paulette . 
1 tsai ming-liang's witty , wistful new film , what time is it there ? , is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly . 
0 writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability . 
0 toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick . 
1 it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
1 allen's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal . 
1 steven spielberg brings us another masterpiece
1 there's a spontaneity to the chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout . 
0 somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
1 a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan's heroes star bob crane . 
0 master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
0 never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .

0 competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
1 an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . 
0 everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
0 ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
1 claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications . 
1 while maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman's warmest . 
1 a chick flick for guys . 
0 a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
0 most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 
0 too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
1 the most ingenious film comedy since being john malkovich . 
0 the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
0 we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
0 in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
0 there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . 
0 a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
0 there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
1 the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids . 
1 makes one thing abundantly clear . american musical comedy as we know it wouldn't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun's-sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway . 
1 i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory . 
0 for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . 
0 a minor-league soccer remake of the longest yard . 
1 as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
1 [schweiger is] talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists . 
0 one of the worst films of 2002 . 
0 a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
0 this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of am�lie . 
1 colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor . 
1 koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation .

1 i admired this work a lot . 
1 'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia f�lmica imposible de olvidar'
0 stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here� . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
0 rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
1 celebrated at sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that's hard to beat . 
1 this beautifully animated epic is never dull . 
1 it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya . 
0 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .

1 the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
1 witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image , but it's dench who really steals the show . 
1 despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is amy's self-absorbed personality -- amy's o's honesty will win you over . 
1 the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further . 
1 the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive . 
0 there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . 
0 been there done that . 
0 instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources � good sources , bad mixture
0 the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
1 this is one of polanski's best films . 
0 mildly amusing . 
0 kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
0 the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . 
1 it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes . 
0 outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
0 staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
0 so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
1 beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
1 it trusts the story it sets out to tell . 
0 it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
1 the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence . 
1 300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness . 
1 like mike isn't interested in recycling old cliches . it wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor . 
1 [d]oesn't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful . 
1 it will grip even viewers who aren't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way . 
1 a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family . 
0 the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
1 looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in jane hamilton's exemplary costumes , rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . 
1 the film gets close to the chimps the same way goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection . 
1 in his u . s . debut , mr . schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist . 
1 has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be . 
1 remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster . . . done up by howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand . 
1 if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story ( like , say , treasure planet ) or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i'll take the latter every time . 
0 mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character , he's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
0 if there's one thing this world needs less of , it's movies about college that are written and directed by people who couldn't pass an entrance exam . 
0 this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
0 too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay . 
1 like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn . 
1 devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable . 
1 wonder , hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars
1 [a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
0 it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
1 although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale . 
0 although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . 
0 scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . 
1 the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems . 
1 the thing about guys like evans is this : you're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins . but as you watch the movie , you're too interested to care . 
0 it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style . 
1 arliss howard's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , big bad love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws . 
1 left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte's web of desire and desperation . 
1 far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year's kubrick-meets-spielberg exercise . 
0 it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
1 with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . 
1 a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects . 
0 the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joff� and demi moore's the scarlet letter . 
1 beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve . 
1 it helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well . 
0 the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . 
1 the hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity . 
1 one of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years . 
0 the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
0 what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
1 a thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you cannot separate them . 
1 wedding feels a bit anachronistic . still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin . 
0 the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
0 an uplifting , largely bogus story . 
0 it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
1 the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful . 
0 yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
0 for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
1 a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers . 
0 by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
0 behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
1 it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 
0 this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
0 this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
1 a return to pure disney magic and is enjoyable family fare . 
1 elegant and eloquent [meditation] on death and that most elusive of passions , love . 
0 the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
1 made-up lampoons the moviemaking process itself , while shining a not particularly flattering spotlight on america's skin-deep notions of pulchritude . 
0 it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 
0 a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
1 although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love . 
0 an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories . 
1 apesar de seus graves problemas , o filme consegue entreter . 
1 it's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro . 
1 a marvel like none you've seen . 
1 reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . 
1 simultaneously heart-breaking and very funny , the last kiss is really all about performances . 
1 a sexy , surprising romance . . . idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair . . . their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger . 
0 the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 
0 just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love . 
1 baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within . 
1 it all plays out . . . like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller's time out . 
0 wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
0 a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . 
0 it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
0 the characters are based on stock clich�s , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility . 
1 the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable . 
0 it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
1 strange and beautiful film . 
0 almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability . 
0 a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 
0 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
0 it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
0 if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent . 
0 aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
1 light , cute and forgettable . 
0 here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
0 my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
1 topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs . 
1 that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
1 despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity . 
0 a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
0 while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
0 before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
0 it treats women like idiots . 
0 i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
0 the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
0 the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
0 a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
0 the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
0 the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
0 cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
1  . . . strips bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults . 
0 too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
1 a charming , banter-filled comedy . . . one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface . 
1 an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution . 
0 a collage of clich�s and a dim echo of allusions to other films . 
1 ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a exist�ncia de papai noel era um fato inquestion�vel . 
1 writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear . 
0 they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
1 told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings . 
0 this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
1 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth . 
0  " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
0 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
0 occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring . 
1 like an episode of mtv's undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance . . . indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper . 
0 the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
0 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
0 why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
0 pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
1 if mr . zhang's subject matter is , to some degree at least , quintessentially american , his approach to storytelling might be called iranian . 
0 another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
1 the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came . 
1 diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . 
1 an amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail . 
1 the performances are uniformly good . 
0 more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
0 a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
1 the tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story's morals . 
1 the film's performances are thrilling . 
0 [t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
1 even if you've seen " stomp " ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this ! 
0 the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
1 like the best 60 minutes expos� , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining . 
0 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
0 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
0 if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
0 like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
1 in the director's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes . 
0 as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
1 if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere . 
0 despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 
0 this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
0 illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller . 
0 cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
0 the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
0 i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
1 featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , " sade " covers the same period as kaufmann's " quills " with more unsettlingly realistic results . 
1 more of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director's previous films . 
0 shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives . 
1  . . . takes the beauty of baseball and melds it with a story that could touch anyone regardless of their familiarity with the sport
1 that jack nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend . 
0 [two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
1 reggio and glass put on an intoxicating show . 
1 it is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival . 
0 we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity . 
1 the rare movie that's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it's based . 
1 a very well-meaning movie , and it will stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the world trade center tragedy . 
1 like leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable . 
1 it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . 
1 in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work . 
1 a lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family . 
1 faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , " a walk to remember " succeeds through sincerity . 
0 barely goes beyond comic book status . 
0 a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
1 feature debuter d . j . caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton's narcotics noir to life . 
1 talk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it's hard to stop watching . 
0 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
1 the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly . 
1 to some eyes this will seem like a recycling of clich�s , an assassin's greatest hits . to others , it will remind them that hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking . 
1 somehow ms . griffiths and mr . pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy . 
1 a quiet , disquieting triumph . 
1 the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 
0 there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . 
0 although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
0 there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
0 real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
1 it's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to . 
1 it's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene . 
0 stale , futile scenario . 
0 i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 
0 never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
0 a dreary movie . 
1  ( wendigo is ) why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind . 
1 desta vez , columbus capturou o pomo de ouro . 
0 gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
0 a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . 
0 obvious
1 grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
0 gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
0  . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
1 i found myself liking the film , though in this case one man's treasure could prove to be another man's garbage . 
1 it's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . 
0 while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
0 we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so ! 
0 terrible . 
1 'de niro . . . is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around . '
0 as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
1 smart and taut . 
1 my goodness , queen latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts . she must have a very strong back . 
0 the movie bounces all over the map . 
0 a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
0 the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back . 
1 the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers . 
1 lapaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class . 
1 could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
0 as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . 
0 director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale . 
1 it turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting . 
0 the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
1 inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
0 will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings . 
0 all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure . 
1 i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
0 nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
0 plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
0 not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 
0 a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . . 
1 the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won't be disappointed . 
0 it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
1 hey , who else needs a shower ? 
0 breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
0 everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
0 the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable . 
0 'this movie sucks . '
1 not a film to rival to live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted . 
1 thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began . 
1 to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest . 
1 'no es la mejor cinta de la serie , ni la mejor con brosnan a la cabeza , pero de que entretiene ni duda cabe . '
0 this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
1 this is not an easy film . but it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one . 
1  . . . either you're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you're not . 
0 at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill . 
1 the wanton slipperiness of * corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art . 
0 the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
0 the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
1 with this masterful , flawless film , [wang] emerges in the front ranks of china's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers . 
0 all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . 
1 the cast is phenomenal , especially the women . 
0 what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
1 a very capable nailbiter . 
0 those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 
0 like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
1 a damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film . 
1 a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect . 
0 a picture as erratic as its central character . 
1 if s&m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it's to this film's ( and its makers' ) credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves . 
1 a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of 'home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households . 
1  . . . best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report . 
1 instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . 
1 piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling . 
1 'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
0 for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .

1 'it's better to go in knowing full well what's going to happen , but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists . cynics need not apply . '
0 wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
1 it's not just a feel-good movie , it's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did . 
0 it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
1 does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background . 
0 my own minority report is that it stinks . 
1 though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history . 
1 between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results . 
1 poignant and funny . 
1 a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . 
0 if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ? 
0 despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
0  . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
0 too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . 
0 sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its �lan , humor , bile , and irony . 
1 a portrait of an artist . 
1 were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about cal than does the movie or the character any good , freundlich's world traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising american movies of the year . 
1 chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement . 
1 although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell . 
1 a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
0  . . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . 
0 everybody loves a david and goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from david's point of view . 
0 [a] crushing disappointment . 
1 an exhilarating serving of movie fluff . 
1 andersson creates a world that's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad . 
0  " abandon " will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
1 a tasty masala . 
0 purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
1 it's all about anakin . . . and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect . 
0 there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
1 it's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once . 
0 director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
0 blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period .

0 one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically , the movie is a disaster . 
1 monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
0 a real snooze . 
0 a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set . 
0 the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
0 a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
0 while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
0 takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
0 so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script . 
0 has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick .

1 this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder . 
0 sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
0  . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project ! 
0 instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 
1 this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it . 
1 a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview . 
0 it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 
0 feels shrill , simple and soapy . 
0 the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
0 certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
1 reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others . it also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them . 
0 the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
1 as a vehicle to savour binoche's skill , the film is well worthwhile .

0 two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
1 daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget .

0 it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny . 
0 a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
1 the bard as black comedy -- willie would have loved it . 
1 boldly engineering a collision between tawdry b-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , rose's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer . 
0 everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
0 a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
0 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
0 automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
0 charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
1  " what really happened ? " is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience . 
0 you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
1 hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 
0 anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 
1 k-19 : the widowmaker is a great yarn . 
0 should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
1 beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom . 
0 as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen . 
0 the story really has no place to go since simone is not real�she can't provide any conflict . 
0 preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
0 coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit . 
0 follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
0 while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
0 the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
1 as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut . 
1 notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
0 it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
1 a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic . 
0 this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
1 the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
1  " nicholas nickleby " is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there's no new " a christmas carol " out in the theaters this year . charlie hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a dickensian hero . 
0 overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . 
0 an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
1 although life or something like it is very much in the mold of feel-good movies , the cast and director stephen herek's polished direction pour delightfully piquant wine from aged bottles . 
1 spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around . 
1 lead actress ga� , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , is a towering siren . 
1 unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 
1 a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable . 
0 shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story . 
1  . . . always remains movingly genuine . 
1 a well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity .

0 in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
1 the bourne identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is , but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood . 
1 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor . 
1 exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven� [the film] addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce .

0 despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
0 blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
0 a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
0 a relative letdown . 
0 martin scorsese cria um espet�culo visual que n�o possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
0 an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
0 the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
1 ub equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of 'black culture' and the dorkier aspects of 'white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are . 
1 not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j . k . rowling's books . 
0 written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
1 there's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us . 
0 if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
1 no screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of clones' last 45 minutes . 
0 fairly run-of-the-mill . 
1 greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation . 
0 if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
1  . . . a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations . 
1 kosminsky . . . puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting . 
0 the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . 
0 each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
0 not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
1 cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression . 
0 nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
1 more timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food . 
0 derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
0 essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
0 it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
1 if you like quirky , odd movies and/or the ironic , here's a fun one . 
1 every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible . that , in itself , is extraordinary . 
0 plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
0  . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
1 even better than the first one ! 
1 collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans . 
0 the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
0 john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . 
1 more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . . 
0 the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
0 the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
1  . . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life . 
1 sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film . 
1 a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving . . . 
1 lohman adapts to the changes required of her , but the actress and director peter kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects
1 dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement . 
0 a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
1 this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed . 
0 it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
1 although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work . 
0 howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a bu�uel retrospective . 
0 with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clich�s . 
1 nair's cast is so large it's altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion . 
1 smith's point is simple and obvious -- people's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers . 
0  . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
0 a coarse and stupid gross-out . 
1 this charming , thought-provoking new york fest of life and love has its rewards . 
0 even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
0 no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
0 the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
0 dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
0 the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
0 for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
1 much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words don't really do the era justice . you have to see it . 
1 passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats . 
0 i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
0 this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
1 all the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost . 
1 enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age . 
1 at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts . 
1 a drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy . 
0 it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . 
1 the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . 
1 pretty good little movie . 
0 holden caulfield did it better . 
0 at once half-baked and overheated .

0 unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't . 
1 bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness . 
0 neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
1  ( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism . 
1 cox creates a fluid and mesmerizing sequence of images to match the words of nijinsky's diaries . 
1 in all fairness , i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks . 
0 it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
1 morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start . 
1 one of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind . 
0 a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
1 [stephen] earnhart's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have . 
1 a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle . 
1 a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
1 sex is one of those films that aims to confuse . 
1 if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start . 
0 they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right . 
0 feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
1 though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed . 
0 if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
0 can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
0 a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '
0 this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
0 ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout � and meat loaf explodes . 
1 lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new . 
0 snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
1 a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant 'co-stars . '
0 it's harmless , diverting fluff . but it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre . 
0 why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
0 there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
1 we root for [clara and paul] , even like them , though perhaps it's an emotion closer to pity . 
0 a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
1 the ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham's novel ) constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism
1 uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity . 
1 the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals . it's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after . 
1 absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way . 
0 reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
1 craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters . 
1 a whole lot foul , freaky and funny . 
0 the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
0 the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
1 by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors . 
0 those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
1 a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services . 
1 a graceful , moving tribute to the courage of new york's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice . 
1 nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one . 
0 whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
1 foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling . 
0 the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
0 as steamy as last week's pork dumplings . 
0 what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
0 earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
1 exciting documentary . 
0 it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
1 may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting . 
1 whether or not ram dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness , fierce grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one . 
0 as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
1 a thought-provoking picture . 
1 the band's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring , especially for aging hippies ( this one included ) . 
0 murder by numbers just doesn't add up . 
0 hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 
1 it certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time . 
0 replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
1 metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story . 
0 soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 
1 a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance . 
0 possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio . 
1 a compelling french psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart . 
1 paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks . 
0 bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
0 we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
0 despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
1 the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it's as if it all happened only yesterday . 
1 a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol . 
0 you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . 
0 an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
1 the first bond movie in ages that isn't fake fun . 
1 the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
0 for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 
1 bill morrison's decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful . 
0 maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul " full frontal " seems , well , contrived . 
1 beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling . . . recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly . 
1 call this the full monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux . 
0 the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 
1 on its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny . 
1 as expected , sayles' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances . 
0 the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
1 a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clich�s and showcases a group of dedicated artists . 
0 possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . 
1 the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
0 if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
0 press the delete key . 
1 its direction , its script , and weaver's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that's what you're in the mood for . 
0 a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
0 ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
0 kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities . 
1 the film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun . 
1 10 minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away . 
0 some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
1 the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity . 
0 not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
1 jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema . 
1 what redeems the film is the cast , particularly the ya-yas themselves . 
0 [allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
1 a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant . 
1 as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
1 campbell scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson . 
1 manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas . 
0 aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory . 
0 to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
0 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
1 'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
0 it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
1 [a] strong piece of work . 
0 it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
0 helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
0 a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
0 a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of . 
1 it seems grant doesn't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all . 
0 empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
0 though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
1 though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
1 one of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society . 
0 this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
0 the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
0 sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
1 there are moments of hilarity to be had . 
0 alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
0 what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . 
1 a movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of cho's fans . 
1 one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made . 
0 nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah . 
0 so clich�d that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
0 a mild , reluctant , thumbs down . 
0 weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
0 meanders between its powerful moments . 
0 an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike . 
1 it's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest . 
1 the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music . 
1 if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force . 
0  . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
0 the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
1 a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido . 
0 consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
0 a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
1 i like it . there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane . 
1 a movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling . 
1 if you love the music , and i do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary . . . 
0 at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
1 one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time . 
0 the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
0 the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
0 i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
1 sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this argentinean 'dramedy' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors . 
0 'god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
0 cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
1 this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men . 
0 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . 
1 the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
0 even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
0 goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
0 offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
0  . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
0 a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
0 the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
0 the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
0 when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that's a bad sign . a very bad sign . 
1 this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative . 
0 when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
1 whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck . 
0 once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
1 one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . 
1 it's tough to watch , but it's a fantastic movie . 
1 it treats ana's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film . 
0 hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
1 the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing . 
0 one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud . 
1 perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
0 always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
1 exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere . 
1 ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much . 
1 even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . 
0 while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
0 schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
1 the beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor . 
1  . . . it's as comprehensible as any dummies guide , something even non-techies can enjoy . 
1 noyce has worked wonders with the material . 
1 harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness . 
0 very stupid and annoying . 
0 as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
1 to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer's 'divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that's not saying much . 
1 if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle . 
1 it's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
0 the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
0 77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
0 aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
0 ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
1 romantic , riveting and handsomely animated . 
0 while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances . 
0 a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . 
1 a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more . 
0  " bad " is the operative word for " bad company , " and i don't mean that in a good way . 
0 the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
0 too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
1 best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
0 the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
1 a movie of riveting power and sadness . 
1 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids . 
1 the people in jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we're never sure how things will work out . 
1 hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense . 
0 the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
0 like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
0 tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 
0 unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
0 [screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 
1 broomfield is energized by volletta wallace's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles . 
0 the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
1 not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care . 
1 novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach . 
1 my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film , ' because it's about family . 
1 thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun . 
0 it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
0 [javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . 
0 doesn't amount to much of anything . 
1 a jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every clich� of japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage . 
1 if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions . 
0 soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
0 though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . 
0 oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me . 
1 surprisingly insightful
1 much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be . 
1 if you don't flee , you might be seduced . if you don't laugh , flee . 
1 the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it's propelled by the acting . 
0 if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . 
0 every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
1 by the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better . 
1 cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio . 
1 smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities . instead , he shows them the respect they are due . 
0 there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
1 the production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating . 
0 it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out . 
1 dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee . 
0 fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
0 hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
0 it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune . 
0 the film's center will not hold . 
1 pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 
1 a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds . 
0 haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
1 the film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public
0 an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . 
1 neatly constructed thriller . 
1 it's a treat watching shaw , a british stage icon , melting under the heat of phocion's attentions . 
1 salma goes native and she's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon . 
1 tailored to entertain ! 
1 hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness . 
0 at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience . 
0 the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
1  . . . a true delight . 
0 hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
1 the genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates . 
0 when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
0 there's nothing remotely topical or sexy here . 
0 wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
1 simple , poignant and leavened with humor , it's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship . 
1 the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess . 
0 friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ? 
1 an engrossing and grim portrait of hookers : what they think of themselves and their clients . 
0 unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
0 uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
1 it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case . 
0 i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
0 the plot is nothing but boilerplate clich�s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
0 choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
0 boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
1 though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance . 
0 a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level . 
1 the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom . 
0 tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
0 george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
1 suffice to say that after seeing this movie in imax form , you'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of tom hanks' face than his wife is . 
1 it picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film . 
1 irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . 
0 a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers . 
1 some movies blend together as they become distant memories . mention " solaris " five years from now and i'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share . 
1 for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . if you're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
0 hollywood's answer to an air ball . 
0 dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
1 she may not be real , but the laughs are . 
0 'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
1 the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain . 
0 hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
1 the determination of pinochet's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director patricio guzman's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop . 
1 if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
1 the mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted . 
0 it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
0 most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
0 it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
0 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
0 the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
1 kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 
0 what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 
1 leguizamo and jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb . 
1 a wildly entertaining scan of evans' career . 
0 a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
1 a true pleasure . 
1 pete's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish . 
1 maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards . 
1 director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve . 
1 occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective . 
0 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
1 once again , director jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action/effects on the spectacular scale . 
1 the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there . 
0 when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
1 it's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice . 
0 jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips . 
1 crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action . 
1 one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce . 
0 tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
0 the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
0 it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
0 enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
0 it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
0 the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
1 this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i'd expected it to be . 
0 the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
1 the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time . 
1 the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense . 
1 even the digressions are funny . 
0 a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
0 this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
1 meant for star wars fans . it is there to give them a good time . 
1 a moody horror/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director's well-known narrative gamesmanship . 
1 a headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity . 
0 a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
1 the film is quiet , threatening and unforgettable . 
0 not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies . 
1 beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm . 
1  " frailty " has been written so well , that even a simple " goddammit ! " near the end takes on a whole other meaning . 
0 the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
1 a glorious mess . 
0 the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
1 gently humorous and touching . 
1 gambling and throwing a basketball game for money isn't a new plot -- in fact toback himself used it in black and white . but toback's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again . 
0  . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
0 thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
1 while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
0 hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
1 there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . 
0 it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
1 this film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion . 
1 the overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude . 
0 no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
1 shamelessly resorting to pee-related sight gags that might even cause tom green a grimace ; still , myer's energy and the silliness of it all eventually prevail
0 i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno . 
0 the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
0 this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people . 
0 if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish . 
1 the acting alone is worth the price of admission . 
0 although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
1 a modestly surprising movie . 
1 the filmmaker's heart is in the right place . . . 
0 to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
1 one of the pleasures in walter's documentary . . . is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject's mysterious personality without ever explaining him . 
1 ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory . 
0 boy oh boy , it's a howler . 
0 the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
0 brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
0  . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
1 this orange has some juice , but it's far from fresh-squeezed . 
0 a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
1 mordantly funny and intimately knowing . . . 
0 wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
0 they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
1 the closest thing to the experience of space travel
1  . . . could easily be called the best korean film of 2002 . 
1 the gorgeously elaborate continuation of " the lord of the rings " trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j . r . r . tolkien's middle-earth . 
1 this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese's best in more than a decade . 
0 there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
1 it's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness . 
0 perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . 
0 no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
1 woo's fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos . 
1 an elegant and sly deadpan comedy . 
0 a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
1 brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression . 
0 nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too . 
1 scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar . yes , soar . 
1 stuart's poor-me persona needs a whole bunch of snowball's cynicism to cut through the sugar coating . but once the falcon arrives in the skies above manhattan , the adventure is on red alert . 
1 huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair . 
1 it's unnerving to see recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment . good film , but very glum . 
1 both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes . 
1 it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
0 divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
0 i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
0 an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
0 this is junk food cinema at its greasiest . 
1 if you like peace , you'll like promises . 
1 confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture . 
1 a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise . 
1 while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in . 
0 we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
1 colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . 
0 one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
1 see it now , before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles . 
1 for all the wit and hoopla , festival in cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . 
0 hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
0 it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
1 it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 
1 phillip noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , christopher doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of greene's prose , and it's there on the screen in their version of the quiet american . 
0 there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
0 if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 
1 puts a refreshing and comical spin on the all-too-familiar saga of the contemporary single woman . 
1 it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety . 
1 an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch . 
1 'the film is stark , straightforward and deadly . . . an unnatural calm that's occasionally shaken by . . . blasts of rage , and later , violent jealousy . '
0 the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
1 the touch is generally light enough and the performances , for the most part , credible . 
1 the ending feels at odds with the rest of the film . 
1 a must see for all sides of the political spectrum
0 it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
0 are monsters born , or made ? 
1 more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
0 the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
0 wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
1 it's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it doesn't take itself so deadly seriously . 
0 watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
1 the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths . 
0 just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite . 
1 a beguiling , slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in iran . 
1 branagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit . 
0 the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
1 god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness . 
1 ludicrous , but director carl franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining . 
1 woody allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz . 
0 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
0 presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 
0 thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together . 
1 though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation . 
0 while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
1 an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment . 
1 what i saw , i enjoyed . 
0 warmed-over hash . 
0 a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast . 
0 harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
0 not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . 
1 anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women's self-actualization knows few continental divides . 
1 this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane . 
0 truly terrible . 
1 huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face . 
0 smothered by its own solemnity . 
1 a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 . 
1 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it's no glance . it's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing . 
0 it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
0 visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . 
0 [macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is . 
0 not a stereotype is omitted nor a clich� left unsaid . 
0 five screenwriters are credited with the clich�-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
0 though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
0 a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
1 a compelling portrait of moral emptiness
1 just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing . 
0 its one-sidedness . . . flirts with propaganda . 
0 despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
0 interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
1 like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
1 beautifully produced . 
0 sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
1 enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious -- if you've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse . 
1 rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema . 
0 one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
0 trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead . 
1 even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
0 the big-screen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison . 
1 smarter than its commercials make it seem . 
0 a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .

0 one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny .

0 oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
0 an encouraging effort from mccrudden
1 a chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 .

0 eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you don't care who fires the winning shot . 
0  . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
0 even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
0 yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong .

1 so young , so smart , such talent , such a wise . 
0 i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them .

1 rifkin's references are . . . impeccable throughout . 
0 a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
1 may take its sweet time to get wherever it's going , but if you have the patience for it , you won't feel like it's wasted yours .

0 it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
1 maud and roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy . 
0 it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .

0 many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short . 
0 seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors . 
1 a very funny movie . 
1 although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense .
