0 it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
0 i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing .

0 so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
0 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
0 intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area . 
0 director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . 
0  . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
0 outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .

0 a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . 
0 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
0 somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
0 ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
0 the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .

0 unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic . 
0 birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honorï¿½ ) isn't so much bad as it is bland . 
0 christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
0 if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
0 while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .

0 none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor . 
0 the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
0 eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it's only acting . 
0 the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras . 
0 [janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
0 as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
0 this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . 
0 it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary . 
0 the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 
0 it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
0 for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . '
0 what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 
0 [i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
0 an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
0 a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
0 i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
0 roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 
0 it bites hard . 
0 the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
0 make like the title and dodge this one . 
0 no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
0 the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
0 this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
0 goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
0 this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
0 what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
0 yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
0 a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
0 anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '
0 no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
0 the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
0 one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
0 in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
0 it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
0 after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
0 qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
0 a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
0 the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
0 this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
0 a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship . 
0 it's just plain boring . 
0 the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff . 
0 abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
0 due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
0 [t]he film is never sure to make a clear point even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
0 nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
0 a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
0 where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
0 on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it . 
0 the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder .

0 a listless and desultory affair . 
0 jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
0 any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
0 formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
0 at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
0 it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
0 ararat feels like a book report
0 an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension . 
0 alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
0 now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " . 
0 slap me , i saw this movie . 
0 [the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
0 behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
0 well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
0 the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it . 
0 its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
0 just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
0 a quaint , romanticized rendering . 
0 if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . 
0 if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
0 little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
0 the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
0 content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
0 [seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
0 it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
0 becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
0 eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
0 there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups . 
0 we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
0 nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
0 the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
0 the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
0 there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
0 nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
0 what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
0 it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . 
0 distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
0 when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
0 just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
0 a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
0 they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 
0 gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichï¿½s . 
0 it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
0 writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
0 it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
0 the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 
0 high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . 
0 neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
0 may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
0  . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
0 no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
0 about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
0 an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
0 is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ? 
0 upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 
0 the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
0 [the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
0 even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . 
0 one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
0 halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
0 we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
0 smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
0 the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
0 mildly entertaining . 
0 a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
0 little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games . 
0 it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 
0  " feardotcom " has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker . 
0 attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
0 will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting . 
0 i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
0 friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite . 
0 elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
0 at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
0 meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
0 i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
0 the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
0 feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
0 despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
0 makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
0 boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
0 in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
0 the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
0 all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
0 [a] stale retread of the '53 original . 
0 one thing's for sureï¿½if george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
0 low comedy doesn't come much lower . 
0 becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
0 enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
0 some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
0 show me the mugging . 
0 in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
0 at times , it actually hurts to watch . 
0 i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
0 such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
0 despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
0 a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
0 a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film . . . 
0 the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichï¿½d and too often strains credulity . 
0 i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
0 there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
0  . . . really horrible drek . 
0 if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
0 most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
0 piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
0 a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer . 
0 poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 
0 a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
0 ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
0 it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
0 flat , misguided comedy . 
0 the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
0 at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab . 
0 return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
0 while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
0 adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
0 a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 
0  . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
0 disappointing in comparison to other recent war moviesï¿½or any other john woo flick for that matter . 
0 'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
0 an ugly , revolting movie . 
0 there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
0 this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
0 entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
0 wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
0 routine and rather silly . 
0 lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
0 we started to wonder if some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
0 this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
0 marinated in clichï¿½s and mawkish dialogue . 
0 not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
0 remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
0 what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad . 
0 a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
0 the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
0 a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
0 gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
0 the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
0 the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
0 unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you . 
0 all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
0 did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
0 less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
0 too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . 
0 diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
0 blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
0 true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
0 director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
0 it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
0 very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
0 though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
0 it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
0 as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . 
1 perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
1 take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema . 
1 at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts . 
1 while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy . 
1 though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static . 
1 like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series . 
1 steve irwin's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume . 
1 a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . 
1 4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip . 
1 the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity . 
1 if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket . 
1 enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd . 
1 its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it's too slowly paced to be a thriller . [but it's] worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser . 
1 watching haneke's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment . but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting . 
1 [drumline] is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it doesn't do . 
1 you walk out of the good girl with mixed emotions disapproval of justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions . 
1 tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point . 
1 elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone . 
1 jirï¿½ hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . . 
1 benefits from a strong performance from zhao , but it's dong jie's face you remember at the end . 
1 using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead . 
1 an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video . 
1 an incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar ( and peculiarly venomous ) bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy
1 it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment . 
1 it's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental . 
1 you could say that it's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't , but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . 
1 easier to respect than enthuse over , andersson's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing . 
1 bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake . 
1 absorbing character study by andrï¿½ turpin . 
1 if you love reading and/or poetry , then by all means check it out . you'll probably love it . 
1 by the end of no such thing the audience , like beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster . 
1 george clooney proves he's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind . 
1 one hour photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it's just too bad it doesn't have more flashes of insight . 
1 starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end . it's still worth a look . 
1 call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film . 
1 the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
1 the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing . 
1 the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue . 
1 the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . 
1 the film delivers not just the full assault of reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days . 
1 [ " take care of my cat " ] is an honestly nice little film that takes us on an examination of young adult life in urban south korea through the hearts and minds of the five principals . 
1 one of [herzog's] least inspired works . 
1 does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively . 
1 a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
1 a pleasant romantic comedy . 
1 greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill
1 a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances . 
1 hilarious , acidic brit comedy . 
1 it's not life-affirming ï¿½ its vulgar and mean , but i liked it . 
1 an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece . 
1 this is pretty dicey material . but some unexpected zigs and zags help . 
1 it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks . 
1 the warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be . 
1 this is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives . 
1 a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it . 
1 this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable .
