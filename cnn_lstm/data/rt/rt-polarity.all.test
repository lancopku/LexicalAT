0 earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
0 the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
0 a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
0 as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . 
0 most of the action setups are incoherent . 
0 there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes . 
0 all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
0 the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . 
0 apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 " black and white portable tv . 
0 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
0 has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
0 the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
0 it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
0 to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
0 overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
0 not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey . 
0 all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone . 
0 beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
0 the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
0 there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
0  . . . too dull to enjoy . 
0 eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
0 de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
0 human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
0 the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
0 drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
0 the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
0 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
0 safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye . 
0  . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core . 
0 sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre . 
0 you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
0 this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . 
0 the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
0 a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
0 the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable na�vet� and arbitrary flashbacks . 
0 when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean . 
0 the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus . 
0 it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future . 
0 a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
0 a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick . 
0 what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best . 
0 i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen . 
0 a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
0 though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation . 
0 unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
0 'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates . 
0 it never rises to its clever what-if concept . 
0 grating and tedious . 
0 the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . it's too bad nothing else is . 
0 the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
0 uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 
0 it's all surface psychodramatics . 
0 there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
0 [seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
0 the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
0 it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 
0 this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
0 like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
0 the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
0 impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
0 seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
0 think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
0 it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective . 
0 the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
0 the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
0 as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
0 to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
0 dramatically lackluster . 
0 entertaining enough , but nothing new
0 works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
0 shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan . 
0 the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
0 you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
0 for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
0 director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it . 
0 finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie . 
0 this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
0 the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
0 loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
0 the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
0 the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design . 
0 a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
0 the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained . 
0 the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
0 an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
0 if disney's cinderella proved that 'a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio's wallet makes . 
0 nothing about this movie works . 
0 if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained . 
0 call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
0  " freaky friday , " it's not . 
0 perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
0 somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
0 its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
0 sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . 
0 while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
0 cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
0 it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
0 a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
0 sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes . 
0 madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
0 handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
0 how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
0 a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 
0 troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . 
0 both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
0 `matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy . 
0 why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ? 
0  . . . unbearably lame . 
0 shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
0 de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
0 wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
0 a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films . 
0 as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
0 what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
0 it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! 
0 its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
0 like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
0 chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
0 strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
0 to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
0 how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . 
0 overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
0 in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
0 a cockeyed shot all the way . 
0 enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . 
0 it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
0 it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
0  . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
0 the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
0 it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
0 too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
0 there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
0 they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film . 
0 it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . 
0 the most horrific movie experience i've had since " can't stop the music . " it may as well be called " jar-jar binks : the movie . " it's that painful . 
0 you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .

0 the chocolate factory without charlie . 
0 deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
0 boring and meandering . 
0 i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks . 
0 it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
0 most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
0  . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
0 overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
0 the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
0 it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
0 rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight . 
0 a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
0 too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
0 epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
0 demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh . 
0 a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
0 it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
0 this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
0 this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn . 
0 a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
0 it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .

0 this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
0 the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
0 it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
0 there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
0 merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
0 passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . 
0 obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 
0 the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
0 ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
0 amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
0 whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
0 each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
0 except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
0 an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
0 for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
0 this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better .

0 as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
0 the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
0 and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> . 
0 from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
0 a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures .

0 unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
0 a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women . 
0 if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
0 the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
